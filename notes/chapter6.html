<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarizing-the-location-of-a-distribution"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Summarizing the Location of a Distribution</h2>
<p>Until this point in our discussions of probability we have relied upon characterizing the behaviour of a random variable via the use of probability mass functions. In some sense, a probability mass function captures all of the probabilistic behaviour of a discrete random variable. Using the mass function you are able to characterize how often, in the long run, any particular value will be observed, and answer any questions associated with this. As a result, the mass function remains a critical area of focus for understanding how random quantities behave.</p>
<p>However, these functions need to be explored and manipulated in order for useful information to be extracted from them. They do not summarize this behaviour effectively, as they are not intended to be a summary tool. We may wish to have numeric quantities which are able to <em>concisely</em> express the behaviour of a distribution. Put differently, provided with a probability mass function it is hard to immediately answer “what do we expect to happen with this random variable?” despite the fact that this is a very obvious first question.</p>
<p>To address questions related to our expectations, we turn towards the statistical concept of central tendency or location.</p>
<div id="def-location" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.1 (Location (Central Tendency))</strong></span> The location of a distribution is a measure of a typical value, or a central value, for that distribution. A measure of location may also be referred to as a measure of central tendency.</p>
</div>
<p>With measures of location we are trying to capture, with one single number, what value is expected when we make observations from the random quantity. There are many ways one might think to describe our expectations, and it is worth exploring these concepts in some detail. In particular, we want to explore how we might think to define the <strong>expected value</strong> of a distribution.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</section>
<section id="deriving-the-expected-value" class="level2" data-number="6.2">
<h2 data-number="6.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deriving-the-expected-value"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Deriving the Expected Value</h2>
<section id="the-mode" class="level3" data-number="6.2.1">
<h3 data-number="6.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-mode"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> The Mode</h3>
<p>One way that we may think to define our expected value is by asking what value is the most probable. This is a question which can be directly answered using the probability mass function. The process for this requires looking at the function and determining which value for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> corresponds to the highest probability. This is the value that we are most likely to see. Sometimes this procedure is fairly straightforward, sometimes it is quite complicated. Regardless of the complexity of the specific scenario, the most probable value has a straightforward interpretation. As intuitive as this may seem, this is not the value that will be used as <em>the</em> expected value generally. Instead, this quantity is referred to as the mode.</p>
<div id="def-mode" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.2 (Mode)</strong></span> The mode of a distribution is the most probable value of that distribution. Specifically, if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a discrete random variable with mass function <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span>, then the mode is the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span> is maximized.</p>
</div>
<div id="exm-mode" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 6.1 (Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Sprinkles)</strong></span> Charles and Sadie have noticed that their favourite coffee shop has been experiencing less foot traffic ever since <em>Probability Patisserie: Cupcake Conundrums</em> has opened up next door.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This cupcake shop has been attracting many of the regular customers, though, Charles and Sadie think that it has more to do with fancy marketing than with a better product. To this end, they go into the store and workout the probability mass function for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, the number of sprinkles on top of the cupcakes. They find the following <span class="math display">\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases} 0.25 &amp; x = 0 \\ 0.3 &amp; x = 1 \\ 0.1 &amp; x = 2 \\ 0.05 &amp; x \in \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]</span></p>

<p>If the mode has these shortcomings, what else might work? Another intuitive concept is to try to select the “middle” of the distribution. One way to define the middle would be to select the value such that, in the long run, half of observations from the distribution are beneath it and half are above it. That way, when you are told this value, you immediately know that it is equally likely to observe values on either side of this mark. This is also a particularly intuitive definition for expected value, and is important enough to be named, the median.</p>
<div id="def-median" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.3 (Median)</strong></span> The median of a distribution is the value <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> which attempts to have <span class="math inline">\(P(X \leq m) = 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(X \geq m) = 0.5\)</span>.

<p>The median is the midpoint of a distribution and is very important for describing the behaviour of random variables. Medians are often the most helpful single value to report to indicate the typical behaviour of a distribution, and they are frequently used. When people interpret averages it is often the median that they are actually interpreting. It is very intuitive to be given a value and know that half of all realizations are above that point, and half of all realizations are below that point.</p>

<p>Despite the advantages of medians, they have their own drawbacks. For starters, the median can be exceptionally challenging to compute in certain settings. As a result, even when a median is appropriate, it may not be desirable if it is too challenging to determine.</p>
<p>Beyond the difficulties in computation, medians have a feature which is simultaneously a major benefit and a major drawback. Specifically, medians are less influenced by extreme values in the probability distribution. Consider two different distributions. The first is equally likely to take any value between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>. The second is equally likely to take any value between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1,000,000\)</span>. In both of these settings, the median is <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(P(X\leq 5) = 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(X \geq 5) = 0.5\)</span>. However, in the second setting we may observe a value as high as <span class="math inline">\(1,000,000\)</span>. Moreover, this value will be observed as often as the median will be.</p>
<p>The median, in some sense, ignores the extreme value in the probability distribution. In certain settings, this can be very desirable.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Consider the distribution of household incomes. There are a few households that earn an incredibly large amount, compared to the remaining households. If you are interested in understanding the “average household”, the median may be a more appropriate measure, as those households with extreme incomes would otherwise distort the picture provided by most families. In this sense, the median’s robustness to extreme values is a positive feature of it in terms of a summary measure for distributional behaviour.</p>
<p>Suppose instead that you work for an insurance company and are concerned with understanding the value of insurance claims that your company will need to pay out. The distribution will look quite similar to the income distribution. Most of the probability will be assigned to fairly small claims, with a small chance of a very large one. As an insurance company, if you use the median this large claim behaviour will be smoothed over, perhaps leaving you unprepared for the possibility of extremely large payouts. In this setting, the extreme values are informative and important, and as a result the median’s robustness becomes a hindrance to correctly describing the important behaviour.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Between the median and the mode we have two measures which capture some sense of expected value, each with their own set of strengths and drawbacks. Neither capture what it is that is referred to as <em>the</em> expected value. For this, we need to take inspiration from the median, and consider another way that we may think to find the center of the distribution.</p>

<p>If the median gives the middle reading along the values sequentially, we may also wish to think about trying to find the <em>center of gravity</em> of the numbers. Suppose you take a pen, or marker, or small box of chocolates, and you wish to balance this object on a finger or an arm. To do so, you do not place the item so that half of its length sits on one side of the appendage and half on the other. You adjust the location so that half of the <em>mass</em> sits on either side of the appendage.</p>
<p>Throughout our discussion of discrete random variables we have referred to probability as <em>mass</em>. We use the <em>probability mass function</em> to generate our probability values. This metaphor can be extended when we try to find the center of the distribution. If we imagine placing a mass with weight equal to the probability mass at each value that a random variable can take on, we may ask, “where would we have to place a fulcrum to have this number line be balanced?” The answer to this question serves as another possible measure of center. It turns out that this notion of center is the one that we are all most familiar with, the simple average, or mean.</p>
<div id="def-mean" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.4 (Mean)</strong></span> The mean of a distribution is the center of mass of the distribution. For a random variable, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with support <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span>, and probability mass function <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span>, the mean of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} xp_X(x).\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>It is this measure of location which ends up being called the <strong>expected value</strong> in statistics. We will use average, expected value, mean, and expectation interchangeably. In terms of notation, the expected value of a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span>. Mathematically, the expected value is desirable for many reasons, some of which we will study in more depth later on. One of these desirable features, which stands in contrast with the median, is the comparative ease with which expected values can be computed. The summation for the expected value is easy to write down, and typically can be solved (either analytically, or readily with a computer).</p>

<p>While the mean provides a useful, intuitive measure of center of the distribution, it is perhaps counterintuitive to name it the “expected value.” To understand the naming convention it is easiest to consider the application which has likely spurred more development of statistics and probability than any other: gambling.</p>
<p>Suppose that there is some game of chance that can pay out different amounts with different probabilities. A critical question for a gambler in deciding whether or not to play such a game is “how much can I expect to earn, if I play?” This is crucial to understanding, for instance, how much you should be willing to pay to participate, or if you are the one running the game, how much you should charge to ensure that you make a profit.</p>
<p>If you want to understand what you expect to earn, the intuitive way of accomplishing this is to weight each possible outcome by how likely it is to occur. This is exactly the expected value formula that has been provided, and so the expected value can be thought of as the expected payout of a game of chance where the outcomes are payouts corresponding to each probability.</p>

Cost for a Game of Chance

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Suppose that a game of chance is being run. It will cost <span class="math inline">\(\$m\)</span> to play, and the game will pay out values from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span>, according to a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with probability mass function <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span>. The question that we want to know is what should the value be for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, such that, in the long term, a player playing the game will earn no money?</p>
<p>Note that if <span class="math inline">\(X=x\)</span> then a player playing the game will earn <span class="math inline">\(x - m\)</span> for that play, and this will happen with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span>. Thus, in the long run, in <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span> proportion of games the player earns <span class="math inline">\(x-m\)</span>. If the player plays <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> games, then as <span class="math inline">\(N\to\infty\)</span>, the total contribution from these winnings will be <span class="math inline">\((x-m)\cdot N\cdot p_X(x)\)</span>. If we add up this contribution for all possible results, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we get <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} N(x-m)p_X(x) &amp;= N\left[\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) - \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} mp_X(x)\right] \\

&amp;= N\left[E[X] - m\right].
\end{align*}\]</span> Thus, in the long run, the total that the player wins, as <span class="math inline">\(N\to\infty\)</span> will be <span class="math inline">\(N(E[X] - m)\)</span>. Thus, in order for the long run earnings to be zero, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> should be set to be equal to <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is set to be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, then per game the player <em>expects</em> to earn <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span>. This also represents the cost at which a rational actor should be willing to pay to participate. If a game of chance costs more than the expected value to play, in the long run you will lose money. If a game of chance costs less than the expected value, in the long run you will earn money. It is hard to overstate the utility of gambling in developing probability theory, and as such these types of connections are expected.</p>

<p>To interpret the expected value of a random variable, one possibility is using the intuition that we used to derive the result. Notably, the expected value is the center of mass of the distribution, where the masses correspond to probabilities. This means that it is not necessarily an actual central number over the range, but rather that it sits in the weighted middle. While this interpretation is useful in many situations, there are times where the point of balance is a less intuitive description. For these, it can sometimes be useful to frame the expected value as the long term simple average from the distribution.</p>
<p>If we imagine observing many independent and identically distributed random variables, then as the number of samples tends to infinity, the expected value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the simple average will begin to coincide with one another. That is the distance between <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\)</span> will shrink to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. As a result, we can view the expected value as the average over repeated experiments. This interpretation coincides nicely with the description based on games of chance. Specifically, if you were to repeatedly play the same game of chance, the average payout per game will be equal to the expected value, if you play for long enough.</p>

<p>Where the median demonstrated robustness against extreme values in the distribution, the mean does not. For instance, if we consider the distribution of incomes across a particular region, the mean will be much higher than the median, since those families with exceptionally high incomes will not be smoothed over as they were with medians. In this case, the lack of robustness for the expected value will render the mean a less representative summary for the true behaviour of the random quantity.</p>
<p>To see this concretely consider a random variable which with equal probability takes a value between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>. This will have <span class="math inline">\(E[X] = 5\)</span>. Now, if the <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> is made to be <span class="math inline">\(1,000,000\)</span>, the expected value will now be <span class="math inline">\(E[X] = 111115.\dot1\)</span>. This is a far cry from the median which does not change from <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> in either case. This lack of robustness is desirable in the event of the insurance example from the median discussion, but will be less desirable in other settings.</p>
<p>The mean, median, and mode are the three standard measures of central tendency. They are single values which describe the standard behaviour of a random quantity. Each of the three has merits as a measure, and each has drawbacks for certain settings. The question of which to use and when depends primarily on the question of interest under consideration, rather than on features of the data alone.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Often, presenting more than one measure can give a better sense of the distributional behaviour that any one individual will.</p>

<li><p>There is an argument that any of the measures here could work the best, it would depend on the individual’s preferences. The mode makes a lot of sense as, if you are a regular customer, the mode is what you will experience day-to-day; most days you will have the modal number of sprinkles. The median may make sense as it provides a benchmark for measuring what constitutes a lot of sprinkles and a little. Half of the time you’ll end up with a more sprinkled donut, half the time a less. The mean would be particularly interesting to note for the store owners themselves, since the mean is directly tied to totals: if the store knows that they sell <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> cupcakes per day, most days, then they also can expect to use <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> times the mean number of sprinkles in a day. This is helpful for planning.</p></li>
<li><p>The median is likely the most useful measure in this setting. The mode could be useful if happiness were not measured on a <span class="math inline">\(100,000\)</span> point scale. The mean is likely a less relevant value here as we are not particularly concerned with the total happiness, and if there was a large skew or major outliers in this distribution, we would want to determine where the majority fall. This is more analogous to the income example rather than the insurance example.</p></li>
<li><p>In this case either the mode or mean are likely the best gauges. Here we do care about totals, and in particular, we do not want to smooth over outliers. It is very relevant if sometimes a lot of individuals become ill after eating an establishment, and the median would hide this information.</p></li>

<p>Despite the utility of all three measures, the expected value holds a place of more central importance in probability and statistics.

<p>Sometimes the value of a random variable needs to be mapped through a function to give the value which is most relevant to us. Consider, for instance, a situation wherein the side lengths of boxes being manufactured by a specific supplier are random, due to incorrectly calibrated tolerances in the machines. The resulting boxes are perfect cubes. Suppose we are interested in the volume of the produced box not the side length. If a box has side length <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, then its volume will be <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>, and so we may desire some way of computing <span class="math inline">\(E[X^3]\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Generally, for a function <span class="math inline">\(g(X)\)</span>, we may want to compute <span class="math inline">\(E[g(X)]\)</span>.

<p>These functions applied to random variables are often thought of as “transformations” of the random quantities. For instance, we <em>transformed</em> a side length into a volume. While the law of the unconscious statistician will apply to any transformation for a random variable, we can sometimes use shortcuts to circumvent its application. In particular, when <span class="math inline">\(g(X) = aX + b\)</span>, for constant numbers <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, we can greatly simplify the expected value of the transformation. To see this note <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
E[aX + b] &amp;= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}(ax + b)p_X(x) \\
&amp;= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}axp_X(x) + bp_X(x) \\
&amp;= a\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) + b\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}p_X(X) \\
&amp;= aE[X] + b.
\end{align*}\]</span> That is, in general, we have that <span class="math inline">\(E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b\)</span>. Note that part of the property of the linearity of expectation that we can immediately see if that the expected value of any constant is always that constant. If we take <span class="math inline">\(a = 0\)</span>, then we see that <span class="math inline">\(E[aX + b] = E[b] = b\)</span>. Thus, any time that we need to take the expected value of any constant number, we know that it is just that number.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful as linear transformations like <span class="math inline">\(aX+b\)</span> arise very commonly. For instance, most unit conversions are simple linear combinations. If a random quantity is measured in one unit then this result can be used to quickly convert expectations to another.</p>

<p>A key characteristic of the behaviour of a random variable which is not captured by the measures of location is the variability of the quantity. If we imagine taking repeated realizations of a random variable, the variability of the random variable captures how much movement there will be observation to observation. If a random variable has low variability, we expect that the various observations will cluster together, becoming not too distant from one another. If a random variable has high variability, we expect the observations to jump around each time.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-range"><span class="header-section-number">6.5.1</span> The Range</h3>
<p>Just as was the case with measures of location, there are several measures of variability which may be applicable in any given setting. One fairly basic measure of this variability is the range of possible values: what is the highest possible value, what is the lowest possible value, and how much distance is there between those two points?</p>
<div id="def-range" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.5 (Range)</strong></span> For a random variable, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, the range of the random variable is defined as <span class="math inline">\(\text{Range}(X) = \max(X) - \min(X)\)</span>. That is, it is the distance between the maximum value that the random variable can take on, and the minimum value that the random variable can take on. Sometimes the range is reported with these outpoints explicitly specified.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a fairly intuitive notion, and is particularly useful in the equal probability model over a sequence of numbers. Consider dice.

<p>To remedy these two issues, we may think of techniques to modify the range. Instead of taking the minimum and maximum possible values, we can instead consider ranges of values which remain more plausible. A common way to do this is to extend our concept of a median beyond the half-way point. The median of a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, is the value, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(P(X \leq m) = 0.5\)</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. While there is good reason to care about the midpoint, we can think of generalizing this to be <em>any</em> probability.</p>
<p>That is, we could find a number <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(P(X \leq z) = 0.1\)</span>. We could then use this value to conclude that the probability of observing a value less than <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(10\%\)</span>. These values are referred to, generally, as <strong>percentiles</strong> and they are the natural extension of medians.</p>

<p>We can leverage percentiles to remedy some of the issues with the range as a measure of variability. Framed in terms of percentiles, the minimum value is <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(0)\)</span>, and the maximum value is <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(1)\)</span>. Instead of considering the extreme endpoints, we can consider the difference between more moderate percentiles. Doing so allows us to overcome the major concerns outlined with the range. If we take <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(p_1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(p_2)\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(p_1 &lt; p_2\)</span>, then the difference between <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(p_2) - \zeta(p_1)\)</span> can be seen as a measure of variability, analogous to the range.</p>
<p>The most common choices would be to take <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(0.25)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(0.75)\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span>th and <span class="math inline">\(75\)</span>th percentiles, respectively.

<p>With the first and third quartiles computed, we can compute the <strong>interquartile range</strong>, which is given by <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(0.75)-\zeta(0.25)\)</span>.</p>
<div id="def-iqr" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.7 (Interquartile Range (IQR))</strong></span> The interquartile range, or IQR, is defined as <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(0.75) - \zeta(0.25)\)</span>, the difference between the third and first quartiles.

<p>Like the range, the IQR gives a measure of how much spread there tends to be in a distribution. Unlike the range, however, we can be more certain that both the first and third quartiles are reasonable values around which repeated observations of the random variable would be observed.

<p>Both the range and the interquartile range give a sense of the variation in the distribution irrespective of the measures of location for that distribution. Another plausible method for assessing the variability of a distribution is to assess how far we expect observations to be from its center. Intuitively, if observations of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are near the center with high probability, then the distribution will be less variable than if the average distance to the center is larger.</p>
<p>This intuitive measure of variability is useful for capturing the behaviour of a random variable, particularly when paired with a measure of location. However, we do have to be careful: not all measures of dispersion based on this notion will be useful. Consider the most basic possibility, <span class="math inline">\(X - E[X]\)</span>. We might ask, for instance, what is the expected value of this quantity. If we take <span class="math inline">\(E[X - E[X]]\)</span> then note that this a linear combination in expectation since <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span> is just some number. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(E[X-E[X]] = E[X] - E[X] = 0\)</span>. In other words, the expected difference between a random variable and its mean is exactly <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. We thus need to think harder about how best to turn this intuition into a useful measure of spread.</p>
<p>The issue with this procedure is that some realizations are going to be below the mean, making the difference negative, and some will be above the mean, making the difference positive. Our defining relationship for the mean relied on balancing these two sets of mass. However, when discussing the variability of the random variable, we do not much care whether the observations are lower than expected or higher than expected, we simply care how much variability there is around what is expected. To remedy this, we should consider only the distance between the observation and the expectation, not the sign. That is, if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> below <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span> we should treat that the same as if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> above <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are two common ways to turn value into its magnitude in mathematics generally: squaring the number and using absolute values. Both of these tactics are useful approaches to defining measures of spread, and they result in the <strong>variance</strong> when using the expected value of the squared deviations, and the <strong>mean absolute deviation</strong> when using the absolute value. While <span class="math inline">\(E[|X-E[X]|]\)</span> is perhaps the more intuitive quantity to consider, generally speaking it will not be the one that we use.</p>
<div id="def-variance" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.8 (Variance)</strong></span> The variance of a random variable, typically denoted <span class="math inline">\(\text{var}(X)\)</span>, is given by the expected value of the squared deviations of a random variable from its mean.

<p>The higher that an individual random variable’s variance is, the more spread we expect there to be in repeated realizations of that quantity. Specifically, the more spread out around the mean value the random variable will be. A random variable with a low variance will concentrate more around its mean value than one with a higher variance. One confusing part of the variance of a random variable is in trying to assess the units. Suppose that a random quantity is measured in a particular set of units – dollars, seconds, grams, or similar. In this case, our interpretations of measures of location will all be in the same units, which aids in drawing connections to the underlying phenomenon that we are trying to study. However, because the variance is squared, we cannot make the same extensions to it. Variance is not measured in the regular units, but in the regular units, <em>squared</em>.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a random time being measured, perhaps the reaction time for some treatment to take effect in a treated patient. Finding the mean or median will give you a result that you can read off in seconds. The range and interquartile range both give you the spread in seconds. However, if you work out the variance of this quantity it will be measured in seconds squared – a unit that is challenging to have much intuition about. To remedy this we will often use a transformed version of the variance, called the <strong>standard deviation</strong>, returning the units to be only the original scale.</p>

<p>We do not often consider computing the standard deviation directly, and so will most commonly refer to the variance when discussing the behaviour of a random variable, but it is important to be able to move seamlessly between these two measures of spread.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> represent the winnings of a play of this game. We know that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> takes a value in <span class="math inline">\(\{-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(p_X(-1)\)</span> is given by the probability that the die never shows the chosen number. We can view this as <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> independent trials, where each trial is the result of a die roll. If <span class="math inline">\(A_j\)</span> is the event that the die shows the selected number, then we can calculate <span class="math inline">\(P(A_1^C, A_2^C, A_3^C, A_4^C, A_5^C, A_6^C) = P(A_1^C)P(A_2^C)P(A_3^C)P(A_4^C)P(A_5^C)P(A_6^C)\)</span>. Note that each of these probabilities is equivalent, and equivalently equal to <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{5}{6}\)</span>, and so this probability is <span class="math inline">\(\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^6 \approx 0.335\)</span>. The remainder of the outcomes happen if the first time that the number shows up is on toss <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. This means that we have <span class="math inline">\(A_1, \dots, A_{j-1}^C\)</span> and then <span class="math inline">\(A_j\)</span> occurring. As a result, for <span class="math inline">\(j=1,\dots,6\)</span> we get <span class="math inline">\(P(A_1^C, \dots, A_{j-1}^C, A_j) = P(A_1^C)^{j-1}P(A_j)\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(P(A_j) = \dfrac{1}{6}\)</span>, no matter <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and so the total probability here is <span class="math inline">\(\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^{j-1}\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)\)</span>.

<p>To get the <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span> we can apply the standard expectation formula.

To this end <span class="math display">\[E[X] = (-1)\left(\frac{5}{5}\right)^6 + \frac{1}{6}\left[1 + 2\left(\frac{5}{6}\right) + 3\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2} + 4\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{3} + 5\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4}+ 6\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{5}\right].\]</span> Solving this gives approximately <span class="math inline">\(\$0.98\)</span>, so every play of the game you would expect to earn <span class="math inline">\(98\)</span> cents, approximately.

<p>With expectations, we saw that <span class="math inline">\(E[g(X)]\)</span> needed to be directly computed from the definition. The same is true for variances of transformations. Specifically, <span class="math inline">\(\text{var}(g(X))\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(E[(g(X) - E[g(X)])^2]\)</span> which can be simplified with the previous relationship as <span class="math inline">\(E[g(X)^2] - E[g(X)]^2\)</span>. Just as with expectations, it is important to realize that <span class="math inline">\(\text{var}(g(X)) \neq g(\text{var}(X))\)</span>, and so dealing with transformations requires further work.</p>
<p>With expectations, we highlighted linear transformations as a special case, with <span class="math inline">\(g(X) = aX + b\)</span>. For the variance, the linear transformations are also worth distinguishing from others. In particular, <span class="math display">\[\text{var}(aX + b) = a^2\text{var}(X).\]</span> In the same way that the linearity of expectation demonstrates that the expected value of any constant is that constant, we can use this identity to show that the variance of constant is zero. However, we can also reason to this based on our definitions so far. Suppose that we have a random variable which is constant.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> A constant <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> can be seen as a random variable with probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x) = 1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(x=b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x) = 0\)</span> otherwise. The expected value is going to be <span class="math inline">\(E[X] = 1(b) = b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(E[X^2] = 1(b)^2 = b^2\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(\text{var}(b) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 = b^2 - b^2 = 0\)</span>. From an intuitive perspective, there is no variation around the mean of a constant. It is always the same value. As a result, when taking the variance, we know that it should be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>

<p>Thus, when applying a linear transformation, only the multiplicative constant matters, and it transforms the variance by a squared factor. This should make some intuitive sense that the additive constant does not change anything. If we consider that variance is a measure of spread, adding a constant value to our random quantity will not make it more or less spread out, it will simply shift where the spread is located. This is not true of the mean, which measures where the center of the distribution is, which helps explain why the result identities are different.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>As a general rule when learning it is often helpful to consider exercises of discovery. That is, try to determine <em>why</em> particular definitions are the way that they are, or where they have from.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>You should picture the owner of this fictitious cupcake store as a giant, multinational, faceless corporation. A corporation that seems to take pleasure in stepping on the local businesses. That way, as Charles and Sadie try to fight back, we can remain on their side!<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>When multiple modes exist, convention tends to report the set of all of the modes. In the equally likely outcome model, this is the entire support for the random variable, and as a result, the mode is exactly the probability mass function. There is no summary provided.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>You will find many introductory sources that say that you should always use the median when you are concerned with extreme values. This is a great oversimplification of the truth, and points to a general rule in Statistics: there are very few general rules. The guidance comes from the fact that often extreme values skew our perceptions of the underlying truth. While this may be true in general, it is not true often enough to warrant being given as universal guidance.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn6"><p>While less commonly applied than the simple average, a weighted average is familiar to most students for a crucial purpose: grade calculations. If you view the weight of each item in a course as a probability mass, and the grade you scored as the value, then your final grade in the course is exactly the expected value of this distribution.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>The data is one consideration for which measure to use, but not the only one (and not the most important one).<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>and an attractive one, but a mistake nonetheless.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn10"><p>For instance, suppose you are betting a certain amount on the results of a coin toss, or that you are taking a multiple choice test that gives <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> points for a correct answer.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>Try working this out!<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn13"><p>Note that, when dealing with discrete random variables, it may not be possible to find a value <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(p)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(P(X \leq \zeta(p)) = p\)</span> exactly. Instead, we typically define the percentile here to be such that <span class="math inline">\(P(X &lt; \zeta(p)) &lt; p \leq P(X \leq \zeta(p))\)</span>.<a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>The reasons for this are plentiful, but generally squares are easier to handle than absolute values, and as a result become more natural quantities to consider.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
