<p>The primary concern with point estimation is that, regardless of the procedure we use, we never expect that <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span> will equal the true parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. Instead, by using statistically valid estimation techniques, we hope to have estimators that are <em>close</em> to the truth. Moreover, using the sampling distribution, or assessing the MSE of an estimator can quantify how <em>close</em> is close. Still, even the most performant estimators are unlikely to exactly equal the truth. What’s more, reporting the estimated value will not, on its own, convey any information about the reliability of the estimator. To solve these issues we can turn to <strong>interval estimation</strong>. Specifically, with interval estimation we form estimators that do not give a single value for a parameter of interest, but rather, a range of plausible values.</p>
<div id="def-interval-estimator" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 14.1 (Interval Estimator)</strong></span> An interval estimator is a mathematical procedure (function) that takes in observable data (from a sample) and outputs an estimated range for a parameter value. Interval estimators are specific to the parameter that they are attempting to estimate.</p>
</div>
<p>There are several types of interval estimators, including confidence intervals, credible intervals, likelihood intervals, and prediction intervals. Confidence intervals are rooted in frequentist probability theory, the framework we have been exploring throughout, and will serve as the primary focus of this chapter.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> With any interval estimator the goal is to not only provide an estimate of the likely value of a parameter, but also to quantify the uncertainty around this estimate. Providing the interval communicates that, while it is suspected that the parameter is near the point estimate, it is not possible to be entirely sure of exactly where. When reported intervals are more narrow, there is a higher level of precision attributed to the estimate. When reported intervals are wider, there is less certainty ascribed to the estimate. As a result, interval estimates convey a significant amount of information about the parameter, and the estimation procedure that was used.</p>

<p>Ideally, we would like to be able to form an interval that has a direct probability statement associated with it. For instance, we may wish to form an interval, <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta \in (a, b))\)</span> is known explicitly. Unfortunately, in the frequentist paradigm, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is not a random quantity. The statement <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta \in (a, b))\)</span> is akin to writing <span class="math inline">\(P(2 \in (4, 6))\)</span>: this probability is either <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or it is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> We need to hold in mind that the uncertainty in estimation does not stem from the parameter value, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, and instead stems from the estimator, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span> (and its sampling distribution).</p>
<p>The statement <span class="math inline">\(P(\widehat{\theta} \in (a, b))\)</span> can be interpreted as a sensible probability, where here the probability is taken with respect to the sampling distribution. To form our confidence intervals, we start with this idea. Specifically, we attempt to find values <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(P(a \leq \widehat{\theta} \leq b) = p\)</span> for some suitably high threshold, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This interval, <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span>, can be thought of as an interval that will contain the estimated value with high probability. If <span class="math inline">\(p=0.95\)</span> then, based on the sampling distribution, there is a <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> chance that the computed estimator will fall between <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that this interval, <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> is not yet an interval for the true parameter; it is an interval for our estimator. However, it will almost always be the case that the endpoints of the interval, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, depend on the parameters of the sampling distribution. Recall that the sampling distribution’s parameters are connected to the population distribution’s parameters, and so we can view <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> as depending directly on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. To emphasize this point, we write <span class="math display">\[P\left(a(\theta) \leq \widehat{\theta} \leq b(\theta)\right) = p.\]</span> It is important to remember that, in this expression, the only random quantity is <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span>. However, we have an expression that we know will be true with high probability, that contains both <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span>. We can exploit this to form confidence intervals.</p>
<p>The lower bound of our interval occurs where <span class="math inline">\(a(\theta) = \widehat{\theta}\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is some function of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, and so we can think of the <em>inverse function</em> of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, and apply it to both sides.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> That is, <span class="math display">\[a^{-1}(a(\theta)) = a^{-1}(\widehat{\theta}) \implies \theta = a^{-1}(\widehat{\theta}).\]</span> Similarly, applying the same rationale with <span class="math inline">\(b^{-1}\)</span> to the upper bound on the interval provides a secondary bound, <span class="math inline">\(\theta = b^{-1}(\widehat{\theta})\)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>Conceptually, a confidence interval provides an interval that, prior to conducting our estimation, we know there is a set threshold for the probability that the true parameter falls within its bounds. In our framing of the confidence intervals the random variables are <span class="math inline">\(U(\widehat{\theta})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L(\widehat{\theta})\)</span> corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(a^{-1}(\widehat{\theta})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b^{-1}(\widehat{\theta})\)</span>. These can be viewed more generally as <span class="math inline">\(U(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)\)</span>, being functions of the random sample. In this sense, both <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> are point estimators themselves. However, instead of estimating the parameter value directly, they are estimating upper and lower bounds for the parameter value. This is important to keep in mind since, fundamentally, it is the estimator that is random,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> not the parameter.</p>
<p>It is theoretically possible that there are many estimators, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, that would satisfy the given probability statements. We generally need some manner of choosing which interval to use. The most important feature of any confidence interval is the length, which is to say <span class="math inline">\(U(\widehat{\theta}) - L(\widehat{\theta})\)</span>. All else equal, we prefer shorter intervals, since these give a more precise estimate of the true parameter value. We typically constrain our confidence interval definition to be such that <span class="math inline">\(U(\widehat{\theta}) - L(\widehat{\theta})\)</span> is as small as possible, and select estimators that achieve this optimality.</p>

<h2 data-number="14.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpretation-of-confidence-intervals"><span class="header-section-number">14.3</span> Interpretation of Confidence Intervals</h2>
<p>The construction of the confidence interval follows a fairly natural idea. We want an interval with a high probability of containing the truth, and so we start with an interval for our estimator and invert this to have an interval for the parameter. This procedure, while intuitive in construction, obscures the nuance in the probability statements that we can make. We must be very careful in the interpretation of a confidence interval.</p>
<p>Recall that the random component in the interval is the endpoints, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. These endpoints are estimators, and so the probability distribution associated with them is the sampling distribution of the estimators. Sampling distributions capture the behaviour of an estimator when we repeatedly draw samples and compute estimates on those samples. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(P(L \leq \theta \leq U) = p\)</span> means that, if we were to repeatedly draw samples from the population, use those samples to compute <span class="math inline">\(L(\widehat{\theta})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U(\widehat{\theta})\)</span>, and then check whether <span class="math inline">\(L(\widehat{\theta}) \leq \theta \leq U(\widehat{\theta})\)</span> holds, in the long-run <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> proportion of those runs would satisfy this condition. This is how we must interpret the confidence intervals.</p>
<p>Formally, a <span class="math inline">\(100p\%\)</span> confidence interval interpreted by noting that, were this procedure to be repeated across many, many samples, the proportion of these samples that contain the true parameter will tend towards <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> as the number of samples tends towards <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> a statement regarding any specific confidence interval, but rather, it is a statement regarding the procedure of constructing the confidence intervals.</p>
<p>As an alternative framing, we can consider applying the procedure in practice. Suppose that we have yet to take our sample, but we know that we will form the confidence interval as <span class="math inline">\(\left(L(\widehat{\theta}), U(\widehat{\theta})\right)\)</span>. Prior to observing any data, we know that this procedure will have a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> probability of containing the true parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. However, once we collect data and compute the values, we get <span class="math inline">\(L(\widehat{\theta}) = \ell\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U(\widehat{\theta}) = u\)</span> for some fixed values <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. Now, the statement <span class="math inline">\(P(\ell \leq \theta \leq u)\)</span> is either equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(\ell \leq \theta \leq u\)</span> holds, or it is equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise. We do not know whether it is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or it is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, but we do know that the probability is not <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>

<p>The confidence threshold in a confidence interval relates to the procedure, not to any specific interval produced by that procedure. That is, we can put our confidence in constructing intervals in this way knowing that, if we always follow this procedure, over time our intervals will be correct in a specific proportion of cases. However, we cannot use this to make claims about any specific confidence interval. We do not know in any given sample whether the interval is one that contains the truth, or one that does not. In fact, we cannot know this, without learning what the true parameter value is.</p>
<p>This makes confidence intervals clunky to interpret. Notably, the interpretation of a confidence interval never makes reference to the specific interval that we have computed. Instead, the interpretation of the confidence interval gives a description of the procedure that created the interval, and ascribes a level of confidence to this underlying procedure.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Further misconceptions of confidence intervals commonly occur. For instance, individuals will commonly interpret a confidence interval to mean that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> proportion of the sample data lie within the interval. This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the confidence interval is a statement regarding an estimator or parameter value, rather than the sample value itself. From the same sample you can calculate different confidence intervals for different parameters.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Second, this interpretation further relies on the thought that a confidence interval is interpreted specific to a particular sample. This is not the case.</p>
<p>Alternatively, individuals may misinterpret a confidence interval as stating that, were we to repeatedly sample from the population and compute the estimator, in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> proportion of these trials the estimated value will be contained in the interval we have computed. This misinterpretation is appealing as it seems to use the repeated draws from the population. However, note two concerns. First, this interpretation also relies on giving interpretation to the specific interval that we have computed, which the correct interpretation cannot. Second, this interpretation makes a probability statement regarding the estimator, rather than the parameter (or the endpoints of the interval). Remember that <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> are the random components, and they are calibrated such that <span class="math inline">\(P(L \leq \theta \leq U) = p\)</span>.

<li>This does not mean that there is a <span class="math inline">\(90\%\)</span> chance we will see between <span class="math inline">\(1.4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(8.5\)</span> birds. The concern here is that we cannot apply the interpretation to any specific interval. Instead, we need to be thinking about the procedure generating the interval. There is a <span class="math inline">\(90\%\)</span> chance that the procedure generates an interval that is valid, but we cannot know about any specific interval we are looking at.</li>
<li>This statement is just a rephrasing of Charles’ first statement. To have a <span class="math inline">\(90\%\)</span> chance of seeing between <span class="math inline">\(1.4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(8.5\)</span> rare birds is to say that, if you observe birds many, many times, then in <span class="math inline">\(90\%\)</span> of those cases you observe in that range. It is an incorrect interpretation for the same reason as above.</li>
<li>No.&nbsp;Confidence intervals are never making comments about what has been observed in the sample, they are instead designed to be inferential about the population at large. We are not capturing information about past samples. The other important note is that, this is a confidence interval for the mean, not for the observations themselves.</li>
<li>Again, this is a tempting misinterpretation. Here, Sadie has the correct idea of repeatedly performing experiments, however, the idea is not that in repeated experiments the current interval will contain the sample mean. Rather, in repeated experiments, the computed interval will contain the true mean. That is, once again, we need to focus on the population mean not the sample values, and we need to focus on the procedure, not the specific interval.</li>
<li>This confidence interval is not interpreted on its own. However, we can say that, were we to continue to make observations and use these observations to compute confidence intervals, following the exact same procedure, in <span class="math inline">\(90\%\)</span> of those cases we would find an interval that contains the truth. We can also say, practically, that there is a fair amount of variability in the number of birds that are likely to be seen, and so Charles and Sadie should likely prepare themselves for the possibility of wide swings between different trips. An alternative way of interpreting the interval is to note that, before any data were analyzed, the probability that they would calculate an interval containing the truth was <span class="math inline">\(0.9\)</span>.</li>

<p>In practice, the utility of reporting a confidence interval is that it conveys a sense of uncertainty. Wider intervals suggest that we should put less assurance in the value of the point estimate than more narrow intervals. Moreover, given a confidence interval, there is little reason to think that one value in this interval is more likely to correspond to the truth than any other value. We can use the intervals to determine whether decisions that are made on the basis of estimation would be made under all scenarios implied by the interval. If conclusions differ assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\theta = U\)</span> compared to <span class="math inline">\(\theta = L\)</span>, care should be put into making more conservative decisions, since based on the sample there is little reason to differentiate between these points.</p>

<p>While confidence intervals can be derived for any parameter of interest, as previously discussed, we are very commonly interested in the means of populations. Moreover, owing to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of a sample mean is often easy to approximate. We will primarily focus on confidence intervals for the means of distribution. We differentiate the procedure based on whether the population is itself normally distributed or not.</p>
<section id="confidence-intervals-in-normal-populations" class="level3" data-number="14.4.1">
<h3 data-number="14.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="confidence-intervals-in-normal-populations"><span class="header-section-number">14.4.1</span> Confidence Intervals in Normal Populations</h3>
<p>If our population is normally distributed then the sample mean is known to be exactly normally distributed as well. The sampling distribution depends on both the population mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, and on the population variance, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. Suppose that we wanted to determine <span class="math inline">\(P(a \leq \overline{X} \leq b)\)</span>, for some values <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, then we know that <span class="math display">\[P(a \leq \overline{X} \leq b) = P\left(\frac{a - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \leq Z \leq \frac{b - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right) = \Phi\left(\frac{b - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right) - \Phi\left(\frac{a - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right).\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is known then we can use the percentiles of the standard normal distribution to solve for what <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> would have to be. Specifically, if we take the two endpoints to be symmetric, then we want to solve for <span class="math display">\[\Phi\left(\frac{b - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right) = 1 - \frac{1-p}{2},\quad\text{and}\quad\Phi\left(\frac{a - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right) = \frac{1-p}{2}.\]</span> If we did this then we would find that <span class="math display">\[P(a \leq \overline{X} \leq b) = 1 - \frac{1-p}{2} - \frac{1-p}{2} = p,\]</span> as desired.</p>
<p>To solve for these quantities, we note that these are exactly the quantiles of the standard normal distribution. That is, <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}\Phi\left(\frac{b - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right) &amp;= 1 - \frac{1-p}{2} \implies \frac{b - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = Z_{1 - \frac{1-p}{2}}, \\
\Phi\left(\frac{a - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right) &amp;= \frac{1-p}{2} \implies \frac{a - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = Z_{\frac{1-p}{2}}.\end{align*}\]</span> Note that, by symmetry, <span class="math inline">\(Z_{(1-p)/2} = -Z_{1 - (1-p)/2}\)</span>, so we take <span class="math display">\[Z_{(1-p)/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} + \mu \leq \overline{X} \leq Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} + \mu.\]</span> This interval can then be inverted to give an interval for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Namely, <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
Z_{(1-p)/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} + \mu &amp;\leq \overline{X} \\
\implies \mu &amp;\leq \overline{X} - Z_{(1-p)/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \\
&amp;= \overline{X} + Z_{1 - (1-p)/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \\
\overline{X} \leq Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} + \mu \\
\implies \overline{X} - \leq Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} &amp;\leq \mu.
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>These two bounds give rise to the confidence intervals for the mean of a normal population, when <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is known.</p>

<p>When populations are non-normal, there are two possible techniques for forming confidence intervals for the mean. In the first, we can attempt to use the assumed population distribution to derive an exact confidence interval for the mean, based on the true sampling distribution. This would need to be worked out for every individual population distribution, and would be valid only for that distribution. Alternatively, if our sample sizes are large enough, then we can use the Central Limit Theorem to indicate that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X}\)</span> will be approximately normally distributed. In this case, we can follow the same procedures outlined above. Note that doing so will not give <strong>exact</strong> confidence intervals, instead settling for <strong>approximate</strong> confidence intervals. These are often reliable enough in practice.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize that, while the formulae for confidence intervals for the means are used frequently, the process of forming a confidence interval is equivalent regardless of the parameter that is under consideration. Generally, a confidence interval can be found by first finding an interval around the estimator, and then inverting this interval to form one around the parameter value. The key step in this process is determining the sampling distribution for the relevant statistic. As such, when learning confidence intervals, it is best to focus on the overarching procedure and understand where each formula is coming from, rather than specifically pattern matching to find which formula to use. When considering the mean, we use the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> critical values depending on whether the sampling distribution follows a normal or a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution. Recognizing this enables confidence intervals for any parameters for which the sampling distribution is known.</p>
<p>As an example of how this procedure can be applied, consider taking a normal population, and forming a confidence interval for the variance. In order to do so, we would first want to find an interval around <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span> that would hold with probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and then invert this interval. This relies on knowledge of the sampling distribution of <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>.</p>

The Sampling Distribution of <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>If the population is normally distributed, with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, then the sampling distribution of <span class="math display">\[S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2,\]</span> can be derived by noting that <span class="math display">\[\frac{(n-1)}{\sigma^2}S^2 \sim \chi^2_{n-1}.\]</span> This is, notably, not precisely the sampling distribution of <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span> directly, however, it can be manipulated to give probability statements regarding <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Using this result, we can then form a confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>. We start by finding constants, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, such that <span class="math display">\[P(a \leq S^2 \leq b) = p \implies P\left(\frac{(n-1)a}{\sigma^2} \leq \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} \leq \frac{(n-1)b}{\sigma^2}\right) = p.\]</span> Noting the sampling distribution, we require <span class="math display">\[\frac{(n-1)a}{\sigma^2} = \chi^2_{n-1,(1-p)/2} \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{(n-1)b}{\sigma^2} = \chi^2_{n-1,1-(1-p)/2}.\]</span> Unlike the normal distribution, the chi-squared distribution is not symmetric, and the critical values will not be equal in magnitude. We can take this interval for <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>, and solve it for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> instead. Doing so gives <span class="math display">\[\chi^2_{n-1,(1-p)/2} \leq \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} \implies \sigma^2 \leq \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi^2_{n-1,(1-p)/2}} = U(S^2),\]</span> as the upper bound on the confidence interval, and <span class="math display">\[\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} \leq \chi^2_{n-1,1-(1-p)/2} \implies L(S^2) = \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi^2_{n-1,1-(1-p)/2}} \leq \sigma^2,\]</span> as the lower bound.</p>

Confidence Intervals for the Sample Variance
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>For a normally distributed population, a confidence interval for the variance is formed by taking <span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi^2_{n-1,1-(1-p)/2}}, \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi^2_{n-1,(1-p)/2}}\right).\]</span> Here, the critical values from the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> distribution are given by the <span class="math inline">\(1-(1-p)/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((1-p)/2\)</span> quantiles, respectively. This is sometimes expressed using a different definition for the critical values.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note that this derivation follows directly from knowledge of the sampling distribution of <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>. Had we been given a different result, we could have worked through the same procedure, resulting in different interval formula with the same underlying process. This specific result importantly relies on the assumption that the population is normally distributed. Were we in a situation where this is not the case, the formula does not hold, regardless of the size of the sample. To find confidence intervals for sample variances in non-normal populations, we require results regarding their sampling distributions.</p>
<p>It is also worth considering how we may use this result to form confidence intervals for standard deviations. Generally speaking, confidence intervals are <strong>not</strong> invariant to transformations. By this we mean that, even though <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}\)</span>, taking the confidence interval <span class="math inline">\((\sqrt{L(S^2)}, \sqrt{U(S^2)})\)</span> will not result in an exact confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Despite the fact that this will not generally be exactly correct, this is the procedure we tend to use. That is, if we have a confidence interval for a parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, given by <span class="math display">\[(L(\widehat{\theta}), U(\widehat{\theta})),\]</span> and we wish to have a confidence interval for some transformation, <span class="math inline">\(g(\theta)\)</span>, we will typically use <span class="math display">\[\left(g(L(\widehat{\theta})), g(U(\widehat{\theta}))\right).\]</span> As long as <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a nicely behaved function, this will typically result in an acceptably close approximation.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Supposing that we have a confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, then we can form a confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> simply by taking the square root of the endpoints.</p>

<p>When communicating the results of a scientific study, it is typically considered best practice to report confidence intervals alongside point estimates. This conveys the uncertainty in the estimate, and it gives the individual consuming the results the ability to make decisions based on the sensitivity of these results to the reported values. Knowing that you are likely to report a confidence interval, you can use the form of the confidence interval to make planning decisions regarding the study.</p>
<p>When forming confidence intervals for the mean, all the intervals we considered took the form <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X} \pm \Omega\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> depended on the underlying variability, the sampling distribution, the degree of confidence, as well as the sample size. We call this term, the <strong>margin of error</strong>.</p>
<div id="def-margin-of-error" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 14.3 (Margin of Error)</strong></span> In a symmetric confidence interval, the margin of error is defined to be the distance from the point estimate to the upper or lower confidence bounds. That is, a confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> can be expressed as <span class="math display">\[\widehat{\theta} \pm \text{M.E.}(\widehat{\theta}),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\text{M.E}(\widehat{\theta})\)</span> corresponds to the margin of error. The width of a confidence interval is always <span class="math inline">\(2\times\text{M.E.}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>As noted previously, all else equal we would prefer a confidence interval that is less wide. This is equivalent to saying that we prefer a smaller margin of error. We can consider how the various choices that we make may influence the overall width of the confidence interval. Consider a normal population, with known variance. In this setting <span class="math display">\[\text{M.E.}(\overline{X}) = Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.\]</span> The three components of this formula are <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Note that, as <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> increases, <span class="math inline">\(1-(1-p)/2\)</span> also increases, and so <span class="math inline">\(Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\)</span> will also increase. This means that if we want a higher <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the confidence interval must get wider.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Similarly, if <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is larger, then the confidence interval will also be wider. This is not under control of the researcher, but it is to say that in more varied populations, confidence intervals will tend to be wider.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Finally, we see that as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases, the width of the confidence interval will decrease. This is a choice that the researcher gets to make.</p>
<p>Noting that as the sample size increases the width of the confidence interval decreases, we can use this relationship to decide what sample size our study should rely on. Specifically, if a researcher knows the variance (or has an estimated value for the sample variance), then they can determine what <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is required in order to achieve a set margin of error. For instance, perhaps you want to have a <span class="math inline">\(99\%\)</span> confidence interval that will give a margin of error of no more than <span class="math inline">\(0.01\)</span>. By setting the margin of error equal to <span class="math inline">\(0.01\)</span>, and taking <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.99\)</span>, you can determine that <span class="math display">\[n \geq \left(Z_{0.995}\frac{\sigma}{0.01}\right)^2.\]</span> As long as the value for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is correct, this will guarantee the desired result.</p>

<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Exercise 14.33</strong></span> Wire electrical-discharge machining (WEDM) is a process used to manufacture conductive hard metal components. It uses a continuously moving wire that serves as an electrode. Coating on the wire electrode allows for cooling of the wire electrode core and provides an improved cutting performance. A sample of eight wire electrodes used had a coating layer thickness measured as: <span class="math inline">\(21\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(29\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(35\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(42\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span>.

<li id="fn1"><p>Credible intervals are similar to confidence intervals, but approached through the Bayesian paradigm. Likelihood intervals are related to maximum likelihood estimation, and provide a rather interpretable framework for interval estimation. Prediction intervals, as the name suggests, are related to predictive statistics and allow the uncertainty of predictions to be quantified.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>In this case, it is zero since <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is not in the interval <span class="math inline">\((4, 6)\)</span>.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Recall that an inverse function is the function, <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(f(x)) = x\)</span>. So if <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \log(x)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(x) = \exp(x)\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1} = \frac{1}{x}\)</span> and so forth.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Note that very often we will find that <span class="math inline">\(a^{-1}(\widehat{\theta}) \geq b^{-1}(\widehat{\theta})\)</span>, and so the endpoints <em>switch</em>. This is not always the case, but frequently occurs.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>With its randomness endowed thanks to the random sampling<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Note that it is not uncommon to see that an interval is interpretable as “We are <span class="math inline">\(100p\%\)</span> confident that the parameter is in the interval.” This confidence is, importantly, not a probability, and this is taken as shorthand to mean that, if we were to repeatedly find confidence intervals following this practice, in <span class="math inline">\(100p\%\)</span> of them we would find the truth. I think that this statement tends to lead to more confusion, and as such, I would advise against this interpretation until you are <em>very</em> confident in your understanding.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>For instance, we will see how to calculate confidence intervals for both the mean and the variance of a random sample. These will be different and are disconnected from the sample values.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Note, in this case, the true value would be <span class="math inline">\(-2\)</span>, which is fairly close.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Note that, for large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> these two sets of values are essentially equivalent. This means that if you had used the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> values, it would not result in meaningfully different results, however, the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> values are justified in this setting.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>By nicely behaved, we mean monotonic. That is, if <span class="math inline">\(a \leq b\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(g(a) \leq g(b)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g(a) \geq g(b)\)</span> should hold. This means that taking <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = \sqrt{x}\)</span> is nicely behaved, but taking <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2\)</span> is not. The concern with a function like <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2\)</span> comes from what would happen if, for instance, our initial interval were <span class="math inline">\((-2, 2)\)</span>. Then transforming this interval gives <span class="math inline">\((4, 4)\)</span> which is clearly incorrect. There are ways of working around this, however, considerations of more complex transformations are beyond the scope of these notes.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>This should make intuitive sense. If you want to have a <span class="math inline">\(80\%\)</span> chance of containing the truth you can afford to give a narrower interval than if you wanted to have a <span class="math inline">\(99\%\)</span> chance of containing the truth.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>This should also make intuitive sense. If we are trying to understand the center of a distribution, the more spread out our data are, the less certain we will be of our results. The less spread out, the more certain we can be.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
