<p>With confidence intervals and hypothesis tests we began to make inferences regarding populations by quantifying our levels of uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty sits at the core of inferential statistics, and through this we are able to effectively draw conclusions and learn about populations. With that said, the procedures discussed so far have focused on individual parameters from individual populations. While there are many scientific questions relating to a single parameter from a single population, it is perhaps more common to consider the comparison between two populations.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> To answer questions relating to the comparison of multiple populations, we must extend the ideas of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to the setting where we have samples from two (or more) populations.</p>

We then considered parameters of this population<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and addressed questions relating to these parameters. In the two population setting, we introduce a second independent and identically distributed sample, <span class="math inline">\(Y_1,\dots,Y_m\)</span>, from a second population. The distribution for the <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>s may or may not be the same distribution as the distribution for the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>s. Moreover, the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> may be independent of one another, or they may be related to one another. We will take <span class="math inline">\(F_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F_Y\)</span> to represent the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, respectively, and we will use the same notational conventions for the parameters of these distributions. So, for instance, we may take <span class="math inline">\(\mu_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span> to represent the population means, or <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_Y^2\)</span> to represent the population variances. The size of the samples we draw may be equal, or not. We assume that there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations taken from <span class="math inline">\(F_X\)</span> and there are <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> observations taken from <span class="math inline">\(F_Y\)</span>. Each of these samples could be used for individual hypothesis testing or estimation, using the procedures that we have previously seen.</p>
<p>We will typically be concerned with the same parameters and estimators we have been considering previously. For instance, it is common to consider the population means. To this end we have <span class="math inline">\(\mu_X\)</span>, which can be estimated by <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X}\)</span>, and we have <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span>, which can be estimated by <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span>. Even if <span class="math inline">\(\mu_X = \mu_Y\)</span> in practice, it is unlikely that we will observe <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X} = \overline{Y}\)</span>, exactly. This may lead us to consider whether we can perform a hypothesis test that asks whether, based on the observed information, the two populations have exactly the same mean.</p>
<p>To do this, we want to test <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_X = \mu_Y\)</span> versus the alternative, <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \mu_X \neq \mu_Y\)</span>. In order to determine how to test this hypothesis, it is helpful to re-express it as a single parameter. Notice that if <span class="math inline">\(\mu_X = \mu_Y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\mu_X - \mu_Y = 0\)</span>. We can rewrite the previous hypotheses as <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \mu_X - \mu_Y \neq 0\)</span>. If we define a new parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = \mu_X - \mu_Y\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> represents the difference in mean values for the two distributions,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> then we can state our hypothesis test as <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \Delta = 0\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \Delta \neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>This test is no different from any of the tests we have seen before. If we can work out an estimator for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, and work out the null distribution for this estimator, we can use the procedures outlined for null hypothesis significance testing to assess how much evidence exists against the hypothesis that the means are equal. Similarly, if we are able to work out an estimator for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, and we can identify the sampling distribution of this estimator, then we can form confidence intervals for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, allowing both point and interval estimation to proceed for the difference in population means.</p>
<p>In order to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, it is helpful to consider that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = \mu_X - \mu_Y\)</span>. We know that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X}\)</span> is an effective estimator for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_X\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> is an effective estimator for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span>. Taken together, it is reasonable to suggest that an estimator for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[\widehat{\Delta} = \overline{X} - \overline{Y}.\]</span> Since both <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> are unbiased for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta}\)</span> will also be unbiased for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>. If we are able to assess the null and sampling distributions of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta}\)</span>, we can leverage the same procedures for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests we have already discussed. Determining these distributions depends on the assumptions made regarding the distributions <span class="math inline">\(F_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F_Y\)</span>, as well as the relationship between them.</p>
<p>Note that the same general approach could have been used to test hypotheses beyond the equality of the population means. For instance, suppose we wanted to know whether the mean of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> was <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> units larger than the mean of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. This corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\mu_X = \mu_Y + 10\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\mu_X - \mu_Y = 10\)</span>, and so we can test it using <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \Delta = 10\)</span> versus the alternative <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \Delta \neq 10\)</span>. Alternatively, what if we had hypothesized that <span class="math inline">\(\mu_X\)</span> was really half as large as <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span>? In this case, we get that <span class="math inline">\(2\mu_X = \mu_Y\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(2\mu_X - \mu_Y = 0\)</span>. Now, if we introduce <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{2} = 2\mu_X - \mu_Y\)</span> then we can test <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \Delta_2 = 0\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \Delta_2 \neq 0\)</span>. To estimate <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_2\)</span>, we can note that <span class="math inline">\(2\mu_X\)</span> is estimated well by <span class="math inline">\(2\overline{X}\)</span>, and so <span class="math display">\[\widehat{\Delta}_2 = 2\overline{X} - \overline{Y},\]</span> is a reasonable estimator.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Beyond testing additional hypotheses related to the mean difference, we can also test alternative parameters in the distribution using a similar approach. Suppose we have two separate binomial distributions. Here we may have <span class="math inline">\(p_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_Y\)</span> as the relevant proportions, and we may be interested in testing whether <span class="math inline">\(p_X = p_Y\)</span> or not. To do so, we can use the exact same procedure, taking <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = p_X - p_Y\)</span>, and testing <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \Delta = 0\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \Delta \neq 0\)</span>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Because <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p} = \overline{X}\)</span>, we can use the exact same estimator, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta}\)</span>, and continue in the same process outlined above. Alternatively, we may consider the variances of the population. By framing <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X^2 = \sigma_Y^2\)</span>, we can follow a similar procedure, either taking the difference <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = \sigma_X^2 - \sigma_Y^2\)</span>, or, more commonly, the ratio, <span class="math inline">\(\rho = \dfrac{\sigma_X^2}{\sigma_Y^2}\)</span>, and then testing hypothesis such as <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \Delta = 0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \rho = 1\)</span>, versus the alternatives <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \Delta \neq 0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \rho \neq 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The key idea when dealing with two samples from two populations is to frame the question in terms of a parameter of the joint distribution. Then, estimation (point and interval), and hypothesis testing can proceed on the basis of the single parameter that has been identified. At this point, it is a matter of working out the sampling distribution, and implementing the same procedures explored in the one sample case. The difficulty lies in determining the sampling and null distributions of these estimators.</p>

<p>In order to determine the sampling and null distribution when dealing with two samples of data, a key assumption that needs to be clarified is whether or not the populations are independent of one another. If we know that <span class="math inline">\(X \perp Y\)</span>, then it is typically more straightforward to derive the sampling and null distributions. Consider, specifically, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = \mu_X - \mu_Y\)</span>. As discussed, we can estimate <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> using <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta} = \overline{X} - \overline{Y}\)</span>. We have seen that <span class="math display">\[\overline{X} \sim N(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2) \quad\text{ and }\quad \overline{Y} \sim N(\mu_Y, \sigma_Y^2),\]</span> where these are the exact distributions if the populations are normal, and these hold approximately in large samples otherwise. Note that, regardless of the dependence or independence of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, it will always be the case that <span class="math display">\[E[\widehat{\Delta}] = E[\overline{X}] - E[\overline{Y}] = \mu_X - \mu_Y = \Delta.\]</span> That is, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta}\)</span> is unbiased for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>. If we are willing to assume that <span class="math inline">\(X \perp Y\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[\text{var}(\widehat{\Delta}) = \text{var}(\overline{X}) + \text{var}(\overline{Y}) = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{n} + \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{m}.\]</span></p>
<p>If the two samples we take are independent of one another, then we can conclude that <span class="math display">\[\widehat{\Delta} \sim N(\Delta, \frac{\sigma_X^2}{n} + \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{m}).\]</span> This result immediately allows for the calculation of confidence intervals, using the normal based confidence intervals previously investigated, whenever the variance terms, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_Y^2\)</span> are known. If these variances are unknown, then the variance can be estimated using the individual sample variances, <span class="math inline">\(S_X^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_Y^2\)</span>. Replacing <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_Y^2\)</span> with these results in an underlying <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution, with <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> degrees of freedom, where <span class="math display">\[\nu = \frac{\left(\frac{S_X^2}{n} + \frac{S_Y^2}{m}\right)^2}{\frac{(S_X^2/n)^2}{n-1} + \frac{(S_Y^2/m)^2}{m-1}}.\]</span> Note that this is typically a fairly complicated expression, and so instead we will often take <span class="math inline">\(\nu = \min\{n-1,m-1\}\)</span>. Then, confidence intervals for <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\Delta}\)</span> can be formed using the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution, following the same procedure as our other <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution confidence intervals.</p>

<p>Sometimes, even when <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_Y^2\)</span> are unknown, it is reasonable to assume that the variances of the two populations will be equal. That is, we may have good reason to suspect that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X^2 = \sigma_Y^2\)</span>, even if we do not know the value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X^2\)</span>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> In these settings, instead of taking two separate variances, we ultimately have a single parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. When this happens, we can revisit the sampling distribution, noting that <span class="math display">\[\overline{X} - \overline{Y} \sim N\left(\Delta, \sigma^2\left[\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{m}\right]\right).\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is known, then the previously discussed sampling and null distributions are valid, taking <span class="math display">\[\frac{\sigma_X^2}{n} + \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{m} = \sigma^2\left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{m}\right).\]</span></p>
<p>If the variance is unknown, it still needs to be estimated using the data. This can be done using the <strong>pooled variance estimator</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(S_p^2\)</span>. Namely, <span class="math display">\[S_p^2 = \frac{(n-1)S_X^2 + (m-1)S_Y^2}{n+m-2}.\]</span> Leveraging this pooled variance estimator gives <span class="math display">\[\frac{\overline{X} - \overline{Y} - \Delta}{S_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{m}}} \sim t_{n+m-2},\]</span> and the equivalent null distribution when <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is replaced by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_0\)</span>. Note that here there are <span class="math inline">\(n+m-2\)</span> degrees of freedom. Otherwise, the same procedures â€“ either using the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-based or <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-based intervals or tests â€“ can proceed with the pooled variance in place of the independent variances.</p>
<p>The pooled variance estimator represents an anti-conservative approach to quantifying uncertainty. That is, if the same analysis is done with the pooled variance and with the unpooled variances, you should expect narrower confidence intervals and smaller <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values if the pooled variance is used. This can be an effective way of making complete use of prior knowledge, when the variances of the populations are actually equal. However, in the event that the variances are not actually equal, using the pooled variances will lead to erroneous conclusions. For this reason, you should rely on subject-matter guidance to determine whether equal variances should be assumed. If there is a strong scientific basis for the equality of the variances, and the data do not seem to dramatically contradict this assumption, then using pooled variances may be reasonable. Otherwise, you should estimate the variances separately.</p>

<p>The previous discussions centered around testing population means. Implicitly, this investigated populations that are continuous, where the mean is the primary measure of interest. The same techniques apply equally well to considering two population proportions. Namely, if <span class="math inline">\(X \sim \text{Bin}(n, p_X)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Y \sim \text{Bin}(m, p_Y)\)</span>, it may be of interest to us to determine the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(p_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_Y\)</span>. We may wish to proceed either with the estimation (point and interval) of the difference between <span class="math inline">\(p_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_Y\)</span>, or else to test hypotheses regarding the relationship of <span class="math inline">\(p_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_Y\)</span>. Recall that in the case of a single proportion we made use of the fact that, for large samples, the sample proportion will be approximately normally distributed. The same general technique applies in the case of two populations.</p>
<p>Since both <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}_Y\)</span> are approximately normally distributed, their difference will also be approximately normally distributed. Supposing that we are willing to assume that <span class="math inline">\(X\perp Y\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[\widehat{p}_X - \widehat{p}_Y \sim N\left(p_X - p_Y, \frac{p_X(1-p_X)}{n} + \frac{p_Y(1-p_Y)}{m}\right).\]</span> This sampling distribution allows for the construction of approximate confidence intervals for the difference in proportions.</p>

<p>To estimate the difference of two population proportions, <span class="math inline">\(p_X - p_Y\)</span>, from populations that are independent of one another, we can form confidence <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-based confidence intervals.

<p>The same approach can be extended to test hypotheses relating to the population differences. If we consider the hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p_X - p_Y = 0\)</span>, then assuming the null hypothesis holds we know that <span class="math inline">\(p_X = p_Y = p\)</span>, for some value <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. If this is the case then the variance of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}_X - \widehat{p}_Y\)</span> can be expressed as <span class="math display">\[\text{var}(\widehat{p}_X - \widehat{p}_Y) = p(1-p)\left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{m}\right).\]</span> This variance is maximized by taking <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.5\)</span>, and so we can ensure conservative hypothesis tests of the hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p_X - p_Y = 0\)</span> (or the one-sided alternatives). On the other hand, suppose that the null hypothesis was given by <span class="math inline">\(p_X - p_Y = c\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(c \neq 0\)</span>. Then, <span class="math inline">\(p_X = p + c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_Y = p\)</span>, for some proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. In this setting, <span class="math display">\[\text{var}(\widehat{p}_X - \widehat{p}_Y) = \frac{(p+c)(1-(p+c))}{n} + \frac{p(1-p)}{m}.\]</span> This does not simplify in the way that the variance expression simplifies under the null hypothesis of equality. Further, this expression is not easily maximized over <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Without careful choice of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> this approximation tends to perform rather poorly. As a result, if we wish to test <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p_X - p_Y = c\)</span>, for any <span class="math inline">\(c \neq 0\)</span>, then we require alternative procedures, not relying on the normal approximation.</p>

<p>When the populations are independent from one another, regardless of whether a common variance is assumed or not, the two-population problem can be transformed into a question regarding a single parameter by adequately adjusting the sampling and the null distributions. Ultimately, this results in the same <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-based procedures introduced previously. It will often be the case, however, that we cannot assume independence between the populations. If we cannot assume independence between the two populations, there will not be a single method of proceeding with investigating mean differences. Instead, our results will depend on the manner in which the populations are dependent. While many different forms of dependence may be of interest, a common assumption is that the populations are <strong>paired</strong>. By paired we mean that <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> are observations that are naturally connected to one another, for instance, by being measurements of different quantities on the same unit, or measurements of the same unit overtime, or similar. When data are paired, it will always be the case that the samples are of the same size, taking <span class="math inline">\(n=m\)</span>.</p>
<div id="def-paired-data" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 16.1 (Paired Data)</strong></span> Paired data refer to observations in a dataset that are linked to one another through some underlying, natural connection. Data may be paired because they are taken on the same unit, or because the observations are connected in another meaningful way. In paired data, there is an obvious and meaningful one-to-one correspondence between measurements of one variable and another.</p>
</div>
<p>Suppose, for instance, that we measure the same trait at two different points in time, for all the same units. Then <span class="math inline">\(X_1,\dots,X_n\)</span> correspond to the first measurements that are taken, and <span class="math inline">\(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\)</span> correspond to the second. Here, <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_1\)</span> are naturally paired since they are the same unit observed at two points in time. We expect that <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_1\)</span> will be related to one another, though, not exactly the same. The same can be said for <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_2\)</span>, and more generally for <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>. When data are paired they are not independent.</p>
<p>Suppose that, with paired data, we are concerned with hypotheses regarding mean differences, considering for instance <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y = 0\)</span>. In independent samples we considered the difference of sample means as an estimator, <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X} - \overline{Y}\)</span>, where the samples of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> could have been of possibly different sizes. If we consider the same quantities when data are paired, we can rewrite the expression as follows: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\overline{X} - \overline{Y} &amp;= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - Y_i) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n D_i.
\end{align*}\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(D_i = X_i - Y_i\)</span> is the difference between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> within each pair. In other words, when data are paired, we can first consider the differences between observations, giving a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations, <span class="math inline">\(D_1, \dots, D_n\)</span>. Then, using this single sample, we can construct confidence intervals or perform hypothesis tests.</p>
<p>Once the sample of differences is formed, the problem of interval estimation or hypothesis testing is no different from the one sample procedures outlined. The sampling distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{D}\)</span> is exactly normal if both <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> are exactly normal, and it will be approximately normal using the Central Limit Theorem if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is sufficiently large. The expected value, <span class="math inline">\(E[\overline{D}] = \mu_X - \mu_Y\)</span>, according to the exact same logic applied for the independent case. The only slight difficulty is with the variance, where notably <span class="math display">\[\text{var}(\overline{D}) = \frac{\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2 - 2\sigma_{XY}}{n}.\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{XY}\)</span> is the <strong>covariance</strong> between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (<a href="chapter7.html#def-covariance" class="quarto-xref">Definition&nbsp;<span>7.4</span></a>).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Typically, for paired data, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{XY} &gt; 0\)</span> and so the variance will be <strong>smaller</strong> than when it is assumed that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are independent of one another. Because of this, making the assumption that the data are paired is an anti-conservative assumption. There needs to be good reason to suppose that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> really are paired, and that they should be analyzed in this manner, as otherwise the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values may be artificially deflated.</p>
