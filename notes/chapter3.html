<p>There are a plethora of ways to assign probabilities to different events. At the most basic level any rule that maps from the space of possible events to real numbers between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> can be used as rules for probability assignment. That is, probability assignment is a set of rules which says “for this event assign this probability.”</p>

<p>In this case we have <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} = \{\text{H},\text{T}\}\)</span>. Thus, the possible events for which we need to assign probabilities are <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{\text{H}\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{\text{T}\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\{\text{H},\text{T}\} = \mathcal{S}\)</span>. For any probability model we have <span class="math inline">\(P(\emptyset) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(\mathcal{S}) = 1\)</span>. When we say that a coin is “fair” we are saying that <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{T}) = P(\text{H})\)</span>, and since these are the only two possible outcomes in the sample space, we must have that they each have probability <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Not every assignment of probability values is going to be valid. Suppose, for instance, that we have a six-sided die, each side labelled with a number from one to six. If I told you that there was a probability of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>, you would probably call me a liar.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> If, as we have previously seen, probabilities represent the long run proportion of time that a particular event is observed, we cannot have <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> different outcomes each occurring in half of all cases.</p>
<p>Beyond the restrictions that we impose to form “valid” probability rules, we have another concern: scalability. It is perfectly acceptable to indicate that in an experiment with <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> outcomes, the first has a probability of <span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span>, the second of <span class="math inline">\(0.3\)</span>, and the third of <span class="math inline">\(0.45\)</span>. What if the experiment has <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> possible outcomes? Or <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span>? It quickly becomes apparent that enumerating the probabilities of each event in the sample space is not an efficient way of assigning probabilities in practice. A core focus of our study of probability will be finding techniques that allow us to efficiently encode probability information into manageable objects. Once we have done this we will be in a position where we can manipulate these (comparatively) simple mathematical quantities in order to make statements and conclusions about any of the events of interest, even if they have never been explicitly outlined as having an assigned probability.</p>
<p>While we will consider myriad methods for accomplishing these goals throughout our study of probability, we begin with a very useful model which simplifies probability assignment, without any added complexity, and creates a solid foundation for us to explore the properties of probability models. We start by considering <strong>equally likely outcomes.</strong> As the name suggests, the probability model considering equally likely outcomes assigns an equal probability to every possible outcome of the experiment. This is a probability model that we are already distinctly familiar with: flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a card are all examples of experiments which rely on the equally likely outcomes framework.</p>
<div class="proof remark">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Remark</em> (Statisticians and Urn Models). </span>In statistics and probability courses and books you will often have instructors or authors using fairly simple models to illustrate probability concepts. There will often be questions relating to coin tosses, and dice, and decks of cards, and everyone’s favourite: urns. It will very frequently be the case that a statistics question will state that there is an urn with some combination of coloured balls within it, from which you will be selecting some number either with or without replacement. The frequency of these types of examples and questions often feels disconnected from the refrain that “uncertainty is all around us” and that “statistics is relevant to every aspect of our world!”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Why is it that we seldom see questions or examples that are directly tied to these wide spread applications of the lessons and techniques being taught?</p>
<p>In part these simple experiments are cleaner to handle than “real world” situations. We can easily assume that a die is fair and that takes care of any unsuspecting wrinkles that will necessarily come along with the “real world”. This is not dissimilar to working under the assumption of frictionless surfaces in introductory physics, or assuming that human beings are rational in economics. Another key point is that most of us have deep familiarity with dice, and coins, and cards.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The same is not going to be true of stories that are derived from different use cases in the real world. A final important point, and this will be something we see in depth in the coming chapters, is that from a statistical point of view: there is no difference. Once we have the tools to work with these quantities, we have the tools to work with any of the quantities. This actually distinguishes the use of these types of examples in statistics and probability from those for other subjects: at no point is anything that we are learning incorrect, or overly simple - we are just focusing on the raw probabilistic nature of the phenomenon. As a result, we will continue to see these simple models in these notes. I would encourage you, whenever possible, to hold a topic in mind that matters more to you and start trying to draw the parallels between rolling dice, and whatever it is that you may care about.</p>
<p>Why urns, specifically? Well, whether it be coin flipping or dice rolling or card selection, we can model this equivalently using an urn (with <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(52\)</span> items, respectively). The urn becomes more flexible to <em>exactly</em> dictate what the probability of any selection will be, which is a useful way of moving from equally likely models (each ball is equally likely to be selected) to arbitrary models (we can have however many identical balls in the urn as we would like).</p>
</div>
<p>If we have an experiment with a sample space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> which has <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{S}| = k\)</span> total elements<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, then each element of the sample space occurs with probability <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{1}{k}\)</span>. In the case of the coin toss example, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} = \{\text{H}, \text{T}\}\)</span>, and so <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span> and each outcome occurs with probability <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{1}{2}\)</span>. In the case of drawing a card at random, there are <span class="math inline">\(52\)</span> different outcomes, and so <span class="math inline">\(k=52\)</span>, and the probability of drawing any particular card is <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{1}{52}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is critically important to recognize that the equal probability model assigns equal likelihood to the possible outcomes of an experiment, not the possible events of interest. It will not be the case that all events have the same probability. To make this concrete, consider the events <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> “the ace of spades is drawn” and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> “any spade is drawn”. It is clear that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> happens more frequently than <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, even though we have said that this is an experiment with equally likely outcomes. Remember: an outcome is an observation from a single experimental run, an event is any collection of these possible outcomes.</p>
<p>A core goal is then bridging the gap between the probability of an outcome<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and the probability of an event. In order to do so, we will next consider the rules of probability, introducing properties that are required for valid probability assignments, and the techniques for manipulating probabilities to calculate the probabilities of quantities of interest.</p>

<p>We have previously seen that not every probability assignment can be valid. For instance, assigning <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> probability to each outcome on a die leads to a nonsensical scenario. With just a little imagination, we can conjure equally nonsensical scenarios in other ways. For instance, it would make very little sense to discuss the probability of an event being a negative value. What would it mean for an event to occur in a negative proportion of experimental runs? Alternatively, we can consider two events that are nested in one another: say event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is that we draw the ace of spades, and event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is that we draw any spade. Every single time that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> happens, we know that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> also happens. But there are ways that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> can occur where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> does not.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> If I told you the probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> was <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> and the probability of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> was <span class="math inline">\(0.2\)</span>, this would violate our base instincts. How can it be more likely to draw the ace of spades than it would be to draw any spade at all?<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Often in mathematics when we have an intuitive set of rules<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> that particular quantities must obey, we work to add formality through defining properties of these concepts. To this end, we can define the key properties that probabilities must obey in order to be well-defined, valid probabilities. With three fairly basic properties, we can completely specify what must be true in order for a set of probabilities to be “valid”, and to in turn align with our intuitions.</p>

<li><strong>Unitary:</strong> Every valid set of probabilities must assign a probability of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to the full sample space. That is, <span class="math inline">\(P(\mathcal{S}) = 1\)</span>. This is an intuitive requirement as every time the experiment is run we observe an outcome in the sample space. As a result, in every experimental run the event <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Non-negative:</strong> We require that every probability is non-negative. We can have probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, but we can never have a probability less than zero. Again, this is sensible<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> but is important to include in our formalization. Specifically, for every event <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, we must have <span class="math inline">\(P(E) \geq 0\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Additivity:</strong> the final property requires slightly more parsing on first pass. Suppose that we define a sequence of events, <span class="math inline">\(E_1, E_2, E_3, \dots\)</span> such that no two events have any overlap. That is, <span class="math inline">\(E_j \cap E_\ell = \emptyset\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(\ell\neq j\)</span>.

<p>It is worth dwelling slightly on axiom 3. Consider the case of drawing a card at random from a deck of <span class="math inline">\(52\)</span> cards. Using the equally likely outcome model for probability we know that the probability that any card is drawn is given by <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{1}{52}\)</span>. If I were to ask “what is the probability you draw that ace of spades?” under this model you can respond, immediately, with <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{1}{52}\)</span>. Now, if I were to ask “what is the probability that you draw the ace of spades or the two of spades?” then intuitively you likely figure that this will be <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{2}{52}\)</span>. Note that the event <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, “draw the ace of spades” and the event <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> “draw the two of spades”, are disjoint events. Moreover, recall that the union is the “or” and so <span class="math inline">\(E_1\cup E_2\)</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>. Taken together then, <span class="math display">\[P(E_1\cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2).\]</span> The axiom of additivity extends this intuition to an arbitrary number of events.</p>

<p>These three axioms fully define valid probabilities. Any mechanism that assigns probability values to events which conform to these rules will assign valid probabilities. While it may seem counterintuitive that such basic rules fully define our notion of a probability, these rules readily give rise to many other properties that are very useful when working with probabilities.</p>

Now, if we define <span class="math inline">\(E_2^* = E_2\cap E_1\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(E_2 = E_2' \cup E_2^*\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(E_2'\cap E_2^* = \emptyset\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(P(E_2) = P(E_2'\cup E_2^*) = P(E_2') + P(E_2^*)\)</span>. Rearranging this gives <span class="math inline">\(P(E_2') = P(E_2) - P(E_2^*)\)</span>, and we know that <span class="math inline">\(P(E_2^*) = P(E_1 \cap E_2)\)</span>. Thus, plugging into what we found before we get <span class="math display">\[P(E_1 \cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2') = P(E_1) + P(E_2) - P(E_1 \cap E_2).\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>This follows exactly from the argument for (3). To see, first consider <span class="math inline">\(E_2 \cup E_3\)</span> to be an event itself, say <span class="math inline">\(E_4\)</span>. Then we can apply the above result to <span class="math inline">\(E_1 \cup E_4\)</span>. And then we need only repeat the process for the remaining terms.</p></li>
<li><p>We can rewrite <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(E_1 \cup (E_2 \cap E_1^C)\)</span>. These two sets are disjoint, since the one is <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and the other must contain only elements in <span class="math inline">\(E_1^C\)</span>. Then, <span class="math inline">\(P(E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2 \cap E_1^C)\)</span> by <strong>additivity</strong>. Then, through the <strong>non-negative</strong> property we know that <span class="math inline">\(P(E_2 \cap E_1^C) \geq 0\)</span>, and so rearranging we have <span class="math inline">\(P(E_1) = P(E_2) - P(E_2\cap E_1^C) \leq P(E_2)\)</span>.</p></li>

<p>These properties are useful when computing probabilities. In fact, these secondary properties will be used with more frequency than the basic axioms when manipulating probabilities in practice. It is worth building comfort with these properties, early and often, as they will assist in manipulating all probability expressions in the future.</p>
<p>While these properties hold in general for all probability models, it is instructive to focus on the equal probability model to begin building familiarity with probability. These properties allow us to take events – whether compound or simple – and combine, rewrite, and manipulate expressions to assist in the handling of the computations. Consider a simple event, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Recall that a simple event is defined as single outcome of an experiment, and so in this case, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> corresponds directly to an event that may be observed. If our sample space is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> elements large, then <span class="math inline">\(P(A) = \dfrac{1}{k}\)</span> in this framework. For instance, if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the event that a two is rolled on a six-sided fair die, then <span class="math inline">\(P(A) = \dfrac{1}{6}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that a compound event is defined, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. By definition, a compound event can be expressed as a set of possible outcomes from the experiment. Suppose that we enumerate these possible events as <span class="math inline">\(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_\ell\)</span>. Then we know that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> occurs if any of <span class="math inline">\(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_\ell\)</span> occur. Each <span class="math inline">\(b_j\)</span> are elements of the sample space and correspond to possible outcomes of the experiment. As a result, we know that <span class="math inline">\(P(b_j) = \dfrac{1}{k}\)</span>, based on the equal probability assumption. Now, if we take any two distinct events, say <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_j\)</span>, we know that they must be disjoint: <span class="math inline">\(b_i \cap b_j = \emptyset\)</span>. This is because in an experiment run only one outcome can occur. Moreover, we can say that <span class="math inline">\(B = b_1 \cup b_2 \cup\cdots\cup b_\ell\)</span>.Using the axioms of probability outlined above we therefore know that <span class="math inline">\(P(B) = \sum_{j=1}^\ell P(b_j) = \sum_{j=1}^\ell \dfrac{1}{k} = \dfrac{\ell}{k}\)</span>. This holds in general for any compound event in this setting.</p>
<p>If we take <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to be the event that an even number is rolled on a six-sided die, then we would have <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> is the event that a two is rolled, <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> is the event that a four is rolled, and <span class="math inline">\(b_3\)</span> is the event that a six is rolled. There are three such events, and so the probability that an even number is rolled must be <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{3}{6} = 0.5\)</span>, which matches our intuition.</p>
<p>At its core, this process is counting up the number of ways that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> can occur, and dividing by the total number of elements in the set. There were <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> ways of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> occurring, and a total of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> outcomes in the experiment, so the probability becomes <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{\ell}{k}\)</span>. In the equal probability model, this will always be the case. The probability of any event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> occurring is given by <span class="math display">\[P(A) = \dfrac{N_A}{k},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span> is the number of unique ways that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> can occur. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span> is the size of the set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|A|\)</span>.</p>
<p>As a result of this, computing probabilities largely relies on the counting of possible outcomes corresponding to different events. If we can determine <span class="math inline">\(N_A = |A|\)</span>, and the count of the total number of occurrences, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, then we can determine the probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. This study of counting is known as <strong>combinatorics</strong>, and it is where we will turn our attention next.</p>

<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(36\)</span> possible outcomes. In each column, <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> of the options show different numbers, so that leads to a total of <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> outcomes showing different numbers, leading to a probability of <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{30}{36} = \dfrac{5}{6}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, a faster way to approach the problem is to realize that the probability is easier to solve when considering the complement rather than the event itself. Notably, rolling two, fair, six-sided dice gives a total of <span class="math inline">\(36\)</span> possible outcomes. Of these, exactly <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> have equal numbers showing on both dice. Thus, the probability that the two dice show the <strong>same</strong> number is going to be <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{6}{36} = \dfrac{1}{6}\)</span>. Then, using the fact that <span class="math inline">\(P(E) = 1 - P(E^C)\)</span>, and that taking <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> to refer to the event where the two dice show different numbers, then <span class="math inline">\(E^C\)</span> refers to the event that the two dice show the <em>same</em> number. As a result, the probability that we want is <span class="math inline">\(P(E) = 1 - \dfrac{1}{6} = \dfrac{5}{6}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, counting is a matter of assessing the size of a collection of items. Sometimes, this is very straightforward. If you want to count the number of students in a classroom, you start at <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and enumerate upwards through the integers. To count the number of days until the next Holiday, you do the same thing. If you really need to sleep, perhaps you will count imaginary sleep until you drift off. There is not much to this type of counting, and it is certainly deeply familiar to you all. However, it is also quite limited in its utility.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are interested in determining how many possible ways there are of arranging a deck of <span class="math inline">\(52\)</span> cards. You could of course arrange them in a particular order, then count each of those. That would take a tremendous amount of time, so perhaps instead of using an actual deck you just write down the combinations. Still, each combination is going to be <span class="math inline">\(52\)</span> cards long, and keeping track of that all will be a challenge. This seems like an approachable question, and yet, it illustrates how complicated (and large) these types of “counting” problems can become very quickly.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us there are some strategies for simplifying these problems down, some of which you are likely already familiar with. Think about trying to form an outfit where you have <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> different sweaters, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> pairs of pants, and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> options for your shoes. Suppose that any combination of these will work well. How many total outfits are there? Well, if you have already picked your sweater and pants, then there are going to be <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> different outfits using these: one with each of the pairs of shoes. This is true for each possible sweater-pant combination, and so we can count <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> for each one these. In other words, to get the total number of outfits we multiply the number of sweater-pant combinations by the number of shoe options. The same rationale can be applied to count the total number of sweater-pant combinations. For each sweater, there are <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> pairs of possible pants, and so to get the total number we can take <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> for each possible sweater, or in other words, <span class="math inline">\(3\times 4\)</span>. Taken together then we have <span class="math inline">\(4\times 3\times 2 = 24\)</span> total possible outfits.</p>
<p>Another way of framing this is that we have to make three sequential decisions: which of the <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> sweaters, which of the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> pants, and which of the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> shoes are to be worn? When we do this we multiply through the number of alternatives at each decision point to get the total number of combinations. This is known as the <strong>product rule for counting</strong>.</p>
<div id="def-product-rule-count" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 3.1 (Product Rule for Counting)</strong></span> The product rule for counting states that, when there are a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> decisions to be made, and for each decision <span class="math inline">\(j=1,\dots,k\)</span>, there are <span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> options, then the total number of combinations will be <span class="math display">\[N = n_1\times n_2\times\cdots\times n_k.\]</span></p>

<p>This necessitates an application of the product rule for counting. Specifically, we can view this as three sequential decisions, where the first decision is which drink (with <span class="math inline">\(n_1 = 10\)</span>), the second decision is which add-in (with <span class="math inline">\(n_2 = 8\)</span>), and the third decision is which snack (with <span class="math inline">\(n_3 = 12\)</span>).

<p>Once again this is a scenario where using the complement simplifies the problem. If we asked “what is the probability that no 6’s are rolled, on <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> rolls of the die” then we can count the number of possibilities through an application of the product rule. In particular, there are going to be <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> options which are not <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> at each possible step. We can view this as have <span class="math inline">\(n_1 = n_2 = \cdots = n_{10} = 5\)</span>. Thus, the total number of ways of rolling <strong>no</strong> sixes is <span class="math inline">\(5\times5\times5\times\cdots\times5 = 5^{10}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Essentially the same process can be used to count the total number of possible rolls, replacing <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> to get the denominator. This means that there are <span class="math inline">\(6^{10}\)</span> total sequences of <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> rolls, and <span class="math inline">\(5^{10}\)</span> which contain no sixes. As a result, taking <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> to represent the probability that we observe no sixes on <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> rolls of the die, we would get <span class="math display">\[P(E) = \frac{5^{10}}{6^{10}}.\]</span> The question asks for <span class="math inline">\(E^C\)</span> and so we take <span class="math display">\[P(E^C) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{10}.\]</span> This is approximately 0.8385.</p>
<p>Note that if instead of <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> flips they had <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> flips, the probability would be <span class="math inline">\(1 - \left(5/6\right)^n\)</span>. We can plot this over various values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, to see how the number of flips impacts this probability. The probability of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> is marked and we can see that taking <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> tosses gives an ever so slightly greater than <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> probability of losing (0.5177).</p>

<p>Sometimes it is helpful to express counting rules graphically. To do so we rely on tree diagrams.</p>
<div id="def-tree-diagram" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 3.2 (Tree Diagram)</strong></span> A tree diagram is a graphical representation for the product rule for counting. Specifically, a tree diagram puts each of the decisions in sequence, and draws a branch for each separate option, starting from the branches drawn at the previous decision step.</p>
</div>
<p>To draw a tree diagram, you start with the first choice, drawing one branch for each of the <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> alternatives, labelling each. Then, at the second choice, you do the same process at the end of each of the branches you drew for choice <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, this time drawing <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> branches there (so you will have just drawn <span class="math inline">\(n_1\times n_2\)</span> branches). Then for each of those you draw the <span class="math inline">\(n_3\)</span> further branches, and so on and so forth until the end.</p>
<p>If you want to know the total number of choices, you count the end points at the very end of the diagram. Each branch corresponds to a single option. To determine which combination of choices it corresponds to, you read off the branch labels at each branch you take. If you want to know how many possible combinations come with certain options selected, you can look at only those branches which are downstream from the choices that you care about.</p>

<p>While tree diagrams can be quite useful for visualizing a problem, they often grow to be overly complex. As a result, we need to fall back on the numerical representation afforded to us through the product rule for counting. Counting problems, in general, can very quickly become large and complex. For this reason, we have several tools to assist us in reducing this complexity based on common types of problems that we would like to count.</p>

<p>The first useful tool for simplifying these problems is the <strong>factorial</strong>. The factorial of an integer, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(x!\)</span> is given by the product of all integers from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> That is, <span class="math display">\[x! = x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(2)(1).\]</span> If we consider the product rule for counting then note that if <span class="math inline">\(n_1=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_2=2\)</span>, … , <span class="math inline">\(n_k = k\)</span>, then the total number of options is <span class="math inline">\(k\times(k-1)\times\cdots\times 1 = k!\)</span>. The most common reason that this comes up is when we want to order a collection of items.</p>
<p>Suppose that you have <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> books that you want to place on a shelf. You can view this as making <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> sequential decisions: what book goes first, second, third, and so on. There are <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> options for the first book, then <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> for the second (any except for the first one), <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> for the third (any except for the first <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>). This continues down to the last book, and so we conclude that there are <span class="math inline">\(10\times9\times8\times\cdots\times1 = 10!\)</span> ways of arranging these books.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we want to order items from a collection, but we want to only take a subset of these items. That is, suppose that you have <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> books, only <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> of them will fit on the shelf, and you want to know “how many ways can you put <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> books on the shelf, in order, from your collection of <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>?” Using the product rule of counting for this directly, we recognize that there are <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> options for the first, then <span class="math inline">\(19\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(18\)</span>, and so on until there are <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span> choices for the <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>th book to place. We can write this out in a seemingly strange way. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  &amp;\ (20)(19)(18)(17)(16)(15)(14)(13)(12) \\
  &amp;= \frac{(20)(19)(18)(17)(16)(15)(14)(13)(12)(11)(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)}{(11)(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)} \\

<p>This expression is <span class="math inline">\(20!\)</span> divided by <span class="math inline">\(11!\)</span>, and gives the same as our argument from the product rule for counting directly. This is a more general result than our example with books would suggest. If we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> items, and we want to choose <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of them taking into account the order those choices, it will always be <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> divided by <span class="math inline">\((n-k)!\)</span>.

<p>Permutations arise when we select ordered subsets from a collection. We often, in combinatorial problems, talk about ordering, though sometimes what we mean by this is slightly more abstract. Suppose that you want to form a committee with <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> different people, each of which occupies a different role: the president, vice president, treasurer, note taker, and critic. If there are <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> people to select for this then there are <span class="math inline">\(P_{30,5}\)</span> total possible committees that can be formed. While there is not a sequential order here, we talk about this as being “ordered” since we can differentiate between the five roles. Instead of labelling them with their names, we could label them <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and make the ordering more explicit.</p>

<p>Factorials compute the number of orderings for a set of objects, and permutations compute the number of ordered subsets from a collection of objects. What about when we do not wish to differentiate the order of subsets? Suppose that you still need to form a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> person committee, but you do not have explicit roles for the different members of the committee. Here we cannot use a permutation directly, as we know that this takes into account the order.</p>
<p>To determine the number of unordered subsets, we will consider an alternative approach that we could have used for taking ordered subsets. Suppose that we formulate the ordered committee as a two step procedure. First, we select <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> people without concern for their order. Then we choose which order they will have. If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> represents the number of unordered sets of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> from this population, the product rule for counting tells us that the total number of ordered committees will be <span class="math inline">\(M\times 5!\)</span>, since there are <span class="math inline">\(5!\)</span> arrangements of the <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> people. Thus, we can write this down as <span class="math display">\[P_{30,5} = \frac{30!}{25!} = M\times 5! \implies M = \frac{30!}{25!5!}.\]</span></p>
<p>This will be true in general. If we want to select <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> items from a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we will have <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> divided by the product of <span class="math inline">\(k!\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((n-k)!\)</span>. We refer to these as combinations.</p>
<div id="def-combinations" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 3.4 (Combinations)</strong></span> If we wish to select <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> items from a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> items, where the ordering of these selections does not matter, then the total number is referred to as a combination. Mathematically, <span class="math display">\[\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\]</span></p>

<p>We read <span class="math inline">\(\dbinom{n}{k}\)</span> as “<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> choose <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>”, which translates to “select <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> items from a population of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> total options, without concern for their order.”</p>
<p>To summarize: factorials allow us to order a complete collection, permutations allow us to select a subset with consideration of the ordering, and combinations allow us to select a subset from the collection without regard to the order. These three techniques can be used in combination with the product rule for counting to allow us to have very complex total summations.</p>

<p>While most of the problems we address will revolve around permutations and combinations (with heavy use of the product rule), there are additional techniques which are important to know (and recognize when to use). In particular, combinations and permutations each assume that we are sampling from our set <strong>without replacement</strong>. That is, each time you select an item, it is removed from the population. These are the most common situations in these combinatorial problems, however, there are <em>some</em> situations which arise where we need to count the number of ordered or unordered subsets <em>with</em> replacement.</p>

<p>Consider, for instance, forming a password using only lowercase numbers and letters. If you decide on a fixed length for the password, then there are going to be <span class="math inline">\(36\)</span> choices at each decision point, and you want to take an ordered subset of these. This is forming an <strong>ordered subset with replacement</strong>, and to count how many different ways there are of doing this, we can use the product rule. That is, you have <span class="math inline">\(36\)</span> choices at each decision point, and so there are <span class="math inline">\(36\times 36\times\cdots\times 36 = 36^k\)</span> total decisions, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of items to select.</p>
<p>In general, if you have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> total items and you want to make an ordered set of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of these items <strong>with replacement</strong> you will have <span class="math inline">\(n^k\)</span> total ways of doing this.</p>

<p>Forming unordered sets with replacement is slightly less intuitive. Consider rolling <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> dice which are not distinguishable from one another. We know that there are <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> total sides that can show up on each of these dice, but how many different combinations of numbers can show up overall? If the dice can be distinguished we would say that there are <span class="math inline">\(6^k\)</span> possible ways of doing this. However, some of these combinations are going to be equivalent in the unordered world. Take the simple case of <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>. Here we have the following possibilities: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)&amp;\\
(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)&amp;\\
(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)&amp;\\
(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)&amp;\\
(5, 5), (5, 6)&amp;\\
(6,6)&amp;
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>This gives a total of <span class="math inline">\(21\)</span> possible combinations, rather than <span class="math inline">\(36\)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, if we want to find the way of selecting <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> elements <em>with replacement</em> from a total of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, then the number of ways of doing this will be <span class="math display">\[\binom{n+k-1}{k}.\]</span> In our example this gives <span class="math inline">\(\binom{6+2-1}{2} = 21\)</span>.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.4.5.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="permutations-with-identical-objects"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.5.3</span> Permutations with Identical Objects</h4>
<p>Finally, it is worth understanding how to handle identical objects in combinatorial problems. Suppose that, of the <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> books that we wish to place on a shelf, we have <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> copies of one of them, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> copies of another one, and the other <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> have one copy each. Supposing that there is no way to tell these identical objects apart, how many ways can we arrange the bookshelf?</p>
<p>First, if we pretend that all of the items are actually able to be differentiated then there are <span class="math inline">\(10!\)</span> ways of placing these books. Now, in any of these permutations, had we swapped the order of the first book (with <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> copies) the ordering would have been indistinguishable. As a result, for every ordering of the <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> other books, we counted that permutation twice (when it should have only been counted once!). So to address the two repeated copies we need to take <span class="math inline">\(10!/2\)</span>. Now, a similar argument is going to hold for the book with <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> repeated copies. However, instead of there being <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> permutations which are identical, there are going to be <span class="math inline">\(3! = 6\)</span> permutations which are identical. This is because we can reorder the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> copies of the book in anyway we choose, and still wind up with the same overall permutation.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> As a result, the total number is going to be <span class="math display">\[\frac{10!}{2!\cdot3!} = 302400.\]</span></p>
<p>We can see this same result through an alternative construction. First, we select which of the <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> slots should have the first book. We do not care about the order, and so there are <span class="math inline">\(\binom{10}{2}\)</span> ways of doing this. Next, we can select which of the <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> remaining slots should have the second book. Like the first one there will be <span class="math inline">\(\binom{8}{3}\)</span> ways of placing these. Now, there are <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> slots remaining, and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> books to place, so as a result, we can order those in <span class="math inline">\(5!\)</span> different ways, and then slot them into the remaining places in order. This gives, in total <span class="math display">\[\binom{10}{2}\binom{8}{3}(5!) = \frac{10!}{2!\cancel{8!}}\cdot\frac{\cancel{8!}}{3!\cancel{5!}}\cdot\cancel{5!} = \frac{10!}{2!3!}.\]</span></p>
<p>To generalize this, if we want to order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements, such that there are <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> distinguishable elements with <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> of the first type, <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> of the second, and so forth until <span class="math inline">\(n_k\)</span> of the last type (<span class="math inline">\(n = n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k\)</span>), then the total number of orderings will be <span class="math display">\[\frac{n!}{n_1!\cdot n_2!\cdots n_k!}.\]</span></p>

<p>While combinatorics is a field of study on its own, with many intriguing tools and developments surrounding the enumeration of objects, for the purposes of simple probability models these tools will suffice. Ultimately, we care about counting since in the equal probability model, the probability of any event can be determined by counting the number of ways that the event can occur and dividing by the total number of outcomes that are possible. That is, we use these tools to derive <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span>, the total number of ways that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> can occur, and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, the total number of experimental outcomes, and then we conclude that <span class="math display">\[P(A) = \frac{N_A}{N}.\]</span></p>
<div id="exm-poker-hands" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 3.11 (Poker Hand Counts)</strong></span> During one of their conversations, Charles and Sadie were remarking how they never really played poker. As they understand it, in poker you are dealt a hand of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> cards and you want to use these <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> cards to try to match certain sets of cards, some of which are more rare than others. Charles and Sadie start to get hung-up on discussions regarding “straights” and “flushes”.</p>
<p>A straight is any sequence of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> cards in ascending order (where aces can be low, or high). For instance, <span class="math inline">\(7, 8, 9, 10, \text{J}\)</span> of any suit. A flush, is any set of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> cards belonging to the same suit.

<li><p>A straight necessitates drawing five cards in order, with each of any suit. Just as with the straight flush, there are <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> possible starting values for the straight. Once we have selected the starting value, then for each of the five cards we can pick any of the four suits, resulting in <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> choices each. That gives <span class="math display">\[N_A = 10\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4 = 10\times 4^5 = 10240.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>A flush necessitates drawing <strong>any</strong> five cards from the same suit. If we had a suit fixed, there would be <span class="math inline">\({13\choose 5}\)</span> ways of doing this, since we do not care about ordering. If we think about first choosing the suit, we have <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> ways of doing that, resulting in <span class="math display">\[N_A = 4 \times {13 \choose 5} = 5148.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>To find the probabilities of each of these, we need to know the total number of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> card hands. We do not consider order, and so <span class="math inline">\(N = \binom{52}{5} = 2598960\)</span>. Then, the probability is the number of combinations (calculated above) divided by the number of hands. This gives, for straights, <span class="math display">\[P(A) = \frac{10240}{2598960} = \frac{128}{32487} \approx 0.00394,\]</span> and for flushes, <span class="math display">\[P(A) = \frac{5148}{2598960} = \frac{33}{16660} \approx 0.00198.\]</span> As a result, we see that straights are roughly twice as common as flushes are.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Note that to form a straight flush, we first have to fix a suit. There are <span class="math inline">\({4\choose 1}=4\)</span> total ways of doing this. Next, we need to pick which starting value we will use. Once a card has been selected as a starting value, the remaining cards are fixed. The start value ranges from A through to <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>. Correspondingly, we have <span class="math display">\[N_A = {4\choose 1}{10 \choose 1} = 4\times10 = 40.\]</span> As a result, we get that <span class="math display">\[P(A) = \frac{40}{2598960} = \frac{1}{64974}.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>From (d) exactly <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span> of the straights and <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span> of the flushes are also straight flushes. We can thus remove <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span> from the totals of each of these, giving <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{10200}{2598960}\)</span> for straights and <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{5108}{2598960}\)</span> for flushes.</p></li>

<li id="fn2"><p>One of the most famous quotes from a statistician was a thought shared by John Tukey, stating “The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard.” This is a common refrain, and one rooted in truth. Statistics is everywhere, across every field of human inquiry, and can help us make sense of everything from the trivial to the deeply important.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>This does not help to explain why we use urns so much, of course. When was the last time any of us drew a ball from an urn?<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Note that, when we have a set, using the absolute value symbols <span class="math inline">\(|\cdot|\)</span> stands for the <strong>cardinality</strong> of the set. Cardinality is just a fancy way of saying the size or the number of elements that the set has in it.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>A quantity which in the equally likely outcome framework, we know exactly.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>The <code>sample</code> function can also be used without equally likely events by specifying a vector of probabilities, however, this is a less common use case.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>For instance, the Queen of spades being drawn.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>This is actually a scenario where our instincts may lead us awry in some situations. Consider the following from <span class="citation" data-cites="kahneman">Kahneman and Tversky (<a href="#ref-kahneman" role="doc-biblioref">1972</a>)</span>: <span class="blockquote d-block">Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Which is more probable? (a) Linda is a bank teller, or (b) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.</span> A majority of respondents rate (b) as being more probable, even though (a) is contained in (b).<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>These rules, which we call “properties” are formally known as “axioms”.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>What would it mean to have a negative probability? It is perhaps a more interesting question than it seems at first glance. It is a topic that has come up in some pretty strange places and, while it is not presently sensible to call them “probabilities” in a traditional sense, there are interesting results which follow.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>Note: if this is not yet clear to you, that’s okay! In the very next section we begin to discuss how to count the possible combinations in these types of scenarios.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(d_1 = 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_2 = 4\)</span>. Then here, the dice can match when they show either <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, but if the second die shows <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> there is no possibility of having a match at all.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>Factorials are exciting because they always look like they are shouting!<a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>It is somewhat interesting to note how large these values get relatively quickly. This is a comparatively small question: only <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> people with <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> drinks and <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> snacks. If you consider any counting problem with a larger number of items, these problems quickly grow to be intensely complex. For instance, a count of my main home book collection reveals <span class="math inline">\(376\)</span> of them. To order these would give <span class="math inline">\(376!\)</span> possible orderings. In decimal representation this is <span class="math display">\[4.992244775852435618292576458782762114148884082811840265632\dots\times10^{806}.\]</span> This is an <span class="math inline">\(807\)</span> digit long number. This is an incomprehensibly large number. This number is <span class="math inline">\(8×10^{726}\)</span> <strong>times larger than</strong> the number of atoms in the universe. That is, if every atom in the universe were given some arrangements of books to hold onto, they would need to hold <span class="math inline">\(8×10^{726}\)</span> of them in order for all of the arrangements to be held. I point this out because combinatorics <em>explodes</em> in this way. Even simple problems grow out of hand very, very quickly. This is where comfort with the algebraic tools is required, rather than a reliance on intuition. There is simply no way to have intuition regarding the scope of these numbers, at least, not without a lot of practice.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>Imagine I am placing books on my shelf. With <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> books there are <span class="math inline">\(3! = 6\)</span> ways my shelf can look at the end. With <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> books there are <span class="math inline">\(2! = 2\)</span> ways my shelf can look at the end. With <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> book there are <span class="math inline">\(1! = 1\)</span> ways my shelf can look at the end. With <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> books there are <span class="math inline">\(0! = 1\)</span> ways my shelf can look at the end.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Note, this does not help us with the factorials of negative numbers, nor of fractional numbers. Factorials <em>can</em> be extended to these in sensible ways, but these are not for combinatorial purposes and are no longer “factorials” exactly.<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>In fact, the reason that there are <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> ways of doing this with the book with <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> copies is since <span class="math inline">\(2! = 2\)</span>.<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>This is <em>still</em> a deeply unintuitive result to me. To me it feels like it should be harder to get a nice ordering of cards all in a row than it is to find ones of the same suit. And yet, it is about twice as likely to have the straights. Now, if you think about this deeply, it makes a lot of sense: there is a lot more leeway in selecting the straight than the flush. However, my brain refuses to accept this as intuitive. This is something that can often occur in probability questions where the true results can be far from what we would expect. An interesting question is how long does a straight have to be to be less likely than a flush of the same length. Note that the number of ways of choosing a flush will always be <span class="math inline">\(4\times\binom{13}{k}\)</span>, and the number of ways of forming a straight will always be <span class="math inline">\(10\times 4^k\)</span>. If we consider <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(13\)</span>, we can take the ratios of these to see just how much more (or less) likely a straight is. Doing this gives: <span class="font-monospace text-light bg-dark m-2 p-2 block">k=1 gives 0.769. k=2 gives 0.513. k=3 gives 0.559. k=4 gives 0.895. k=5 gives 1.989. k=6 gives 5.967. k=7 gives 23.869. k=8 gives 127.304. k=9 gives 916.587. k=10 gives 9165.874. k=11 gives 134432.821. k=12 gives 3226387.692. k=13 gives 167772160.</span> Up to (and including) <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> cards the straight is indeed harder to achieve. However, this does not last long!<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
