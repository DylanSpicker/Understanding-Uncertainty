<p>Suppose that you have collected a dataset, either through a sample of individuals or else through an experiment. You have likely done this with the understanding that these data provide useful insight into the world around you, that they will better inform decisions, or elucidate the truth about questions of interest. However, the data themselves provide very little information directly. Looking through a spreadsheet of numeric values is not a sound way to gather useful insight from data. Instead, we need to rely on pictorial and summary statistics, which take the data and describe or summarize the useful features that we are likely to care about.</p>
<p>We may use tables, charts, graphs, or other numerical summaries. The idea is that we want to use these tools to describe the <strong>distribution</strong> of the dataset. Recall from our study of probability that the distribution of a random variable is the probabilistic behaviour of the random quantity. The distribution of the dataset similarly refers to what values the data take on, and with what frequency those values occur.</p>
<p>We will continue with the same type of notation that has been used throughout our study of probability. A variable, when it has not yet been observed, will be represented by a capital letter, say <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. This notation will emphasize the fact that, until we have our sample, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be thought of as unknown and random. Once we make observations for a variable, we denote these observations as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. So, if we for instance, observe a sample of <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> individuals, we may observe <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{100}\)</span> for these individuals.</p>
<p>In general, we will use <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> to represent the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th observation of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, in a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. We may have multiple different variables that are observed for each individual. In this case, we may use <span class="math inline">\(Y=y_1,\dots,y_n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Z=z_1,\dots,z_n\)</span>. Generally, the ordering of the data will be arbitrary, which is to say there is no meaningful difference between individual <span class="math inline">\(i=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i=10\)</span>, except that <span class="math inline">\(i=1\)</span> happens to written first in the data. With this notation, we are able to begin considering how to display data for effective summarization. When describing or summarizing data that have been collected, we will consider numeric summaries, tabular summaries, as well as graphical summaries. For numeric and tabular summaries we are thinking about condensing the data that have been collected into key representations of these values. The information will often be presented in the form of data itself – which is to say, a table of summary numbers – however, it is done so in a way to highlight the key features of the larger dataset. The other alternative is to use graphical displays of information.</p>

The Connection between Data and Random Variables

<p>We previously thought of the collection and generation of data through both sampling and experimental design. The idea was that there was a population or a random process which we wanted to understand, but which could not be fully observed. Instead, we rely on being able to observe partial information from this, through our collected data. When we begin to discuss descriptive statistics, we will be considering the description of the data we have collected themselves – the experimental results or sample. The utility of describing these data stems primarily from the fact that, if we have followed best statistical practices while collecting these data, we <em>should</em> find that they are representative of the complete population. We will rarely be able to say that they are <em>perfect</em> representations for the population, but we are able to use our insight from them to draw conclusions about the population.</p>
<p>Because of this we constantly need to keep two quantities in our minds: the population and the sample. From our perspective, the sample is data, they are pieces of information that we have actually observed. The population, however, is random. It is unobservable, except through the sample or experiment. If we envision a numeric variable of interest, for instance, then once we have collected our sample we will have specific numeric values for this variable for those people in our sample. Which values we observe depends on which members of the population we happened to sample, and if we were to take another random sample, we would get different realizations for this. As a result, we can view sampling and observing as performing a <strong>statistical experiment</strong>. That is, there is some random quantity of interest, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, which we only see a value for (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) once we take our sample. At that point, we know that <span class="math inline">\(X = x\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is <em>precisely</em> the notion of random variables introduced earlier on. That is, we view the quantities that we are going to measure as being random in the population, and our observations of them are <strong>realizations of the random variable</strong>. If we knew the distribution of these quantities then we could make different statements regarding the likelihood of observing various events. As a general rule, however, we do not know the exactly population distribution, and instead are trying to make inference about it through the use of the observed values. The notation introduced above emphasizes this point. We use lower case <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to represent the values since lowercase letters represent observations that have actually been made. When discussing the unrealized values in the population, these can be expressed as capital letters.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we conduct a survey of heights in some population. We might say: consider the height of an individual in the population to be a random quantity, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. If we want to understand <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span> we can do so by first drawing a sample of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> individuals from the population. If we draw these individuals independently, then we can think of each individual’s height as a random variable, <span class="math inline">\(X_1,\dots,X_n\)</span> independent and identically distributed from the distribution of heights in the population. Once we actually select and sample the values we observe <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\dots,x_n\)</span>, where we are saying that <span class="math inline">\(X_1 = x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_2 = x_2\)</span>, and so on through to <span class="math inline">\(X_n = x_n\)</span>. At this point, we have seen actual realizations for <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>, and we can use these realizations to try to draw conclusions about <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span>. If we were to repeat this process many times over, each time we did it, we would see different values for <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>, depending on who is included in our sample. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is a random variable.</p>

<p>Graphical displays of information, or graphs, use visual representations of qualitative or quantitative data in order to provide an overview of key features of the distribution. If used well, this can allow for an efficient display of dense information in a manner which is easily interpretable. The type of informational display used depends, primarily, on two factors: what feature of the distribution are you trying to emphasize, and what type of data are you working with. Broadly, the types of graphics for qualitative data will differ from those for quantitative data. As multiple variables are collected, and the relationships between these different variables becomes the most interesting component of the distribution, we may combine both qualitative and quantitative variables together into a single display.</p>
<p>Historically, there has been a set of graphics which are considered standard, and which would be taught in an introductory course. We will understand the construction and utility of several, common visualizations. However, the landscape around data visualization has rapidly evolved in recent years. Aided by powerful and comparatively straightforward computer programs, far more creativity and artistry has been injected into the world of data visualizations. There are plenty of electronic visualizations which are interactive, there are people effectively using video or audio mediums to add to the display, and the constraints of “standard practice” have largely been overcome. This advancement in technology is not a universal gain, as with every possibility of doing something novel and effective with this technology there are at least an equal number of ways to do something which obscures the truth. Still, data visualization has emerged as a field in its own regard, one which combines statistics, design, and artistry together to great effect.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of this, we will not cover the entire suite of historical figures. Graphs such as the stem-and-leaf plot or dot plot, while not entirely without purpose, were created prior to the advent of modern computer graphics. This enabled individuals to construct plots by hand, or with primitive early computers, and these were useful for those settings. The utility of by-hand plot construction is greatly diminished, and the advancement of graphics engines has rendered many of these plots essentially out-of-use. Rather than spend time learning or constructing these, we will instead focus on plots which remain in frequent use.</p>

The Historic Utility of Data Visualizations
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Throughout history there have been many prominent illustrations of the utility of data visualizations. Two prominent examples that come to mind are Florence Nightingale, with her work on causes of death during the Crimean War<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and John Snow, with his work mapping an 1854 cholera outbreak in London.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Florence Nightingale, a British nurse who worked during the Crimean war, recognized that little was being done to prevent illness transmission throughout the military. She also recognized the importance of conveying the information in ways that would be properly seen and processed by those in positions of decision-making authority. Noting that there was a tendency to overlook tables of figures and data, she instead proposed several graphical displays of the information which would more convincingly illustrate the problem. This served as an important step in the use of data visualizations to tell compelling stories with data.</p>
<p>John Snow was an English physician who was an early proponent of the germ-theory of disease. This was proposed as an alternative to the then dominant <em>miasma theory</em>, which more or less attributed disease to “bad air”. After a cholera outbreak in London in 1854, John Snow mapped out the houses in the are which had individuals sick with cholera. Using this graphic, it became evident that the cases of cholera were clustering around a particular water pump on broad street, lending strong evidence to the thought that this was the cause of transmission. This stands as a foundational study in epidemiology which informs practice to this day.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Outside of graphical summaries, we will also consider numeric summaries. These summaries are typically useful for describing particular features of the data which may be of direct interest. These types of summaries are analogous to the summaries we saw for random variables where we condensed probability mass functions into measures of location and measures of variability. When we did this, we lost much of the nuance of the probabilistic behaviour, however, it became far easier to have a general sense of how a random variable will behave. The same concerns will exist in summarizing data. The more we summarize, the more information we will lose, however, the more we will be able to fully appreciate the numeric summaries that we do have. Descriptive statistics is often about balancing these competing interests.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the tools that we will use to summarize data will depend primarily on the type of data that we have. The summaries available to summarize the behaviour of a qualitative variable differ from those available for quantitative variables. We will begin with a discussion of summarizing qualitative variables.</p>

<p>Qualitative variables are those which are not numeric. As a discipline descending from math, statistics centers the ability to quantify information in a large number of its techniques. This presents a challenge with the tools that we have to summarize qualitative data. While the modern tendency to fuse graphics and art has enabled graphical displays of qualitative information, at its core, the process of descriptive statistics for qualitative data relies on first translating the qualitative information into numeric information. While the exact procedure for doing this will depend on the exact data in question<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> the most common method for extracting numeric representations from qualitative data is through the use of a <strong>frequency distribution</strong>.</p>
<div id="def-frequency-distribution" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.1 (Frequency Distribution)</strong></span> The frequency distribution summarizes the distinct values that a variable can take on, along with the number of observations that equalled each value. The frequency distribution can be thought of as the distribution of drawing a single observation from the sample at random.</p>
</div>
<p>The frequency distribution is a useful and intuitive way of summarizing a qualitative variable, numerically. In order to find the frequency distribution, the categories of the variable are listed through, and then the number of observations in each category are tallied up. This can be reported in tabular form, similar to contingency tables<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> or graphically through the use of bar plots.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> When expressed in tabular form, it can be useful to work out the <strong>relative frequencies</strong> in addition to (or in place of) the counts, giving the proportion of observations for each category. This gives added context to the raw numbers themselves.</p>

<p>To express the frequency distribution in graphical form, we typically will make use of a bar plot. A bar plot is a graphic which along one axis (typically the x-axis, though horizontal plots exist) the distinct values of a qualitative variable are listed. Then, along the other axis, the frequencies of those are listed. The values are displayed based on rectangles with equal width for each category, and with a height that goes out to the value that of the observed variable. Then, to read the bar plot, we observe which rectangles are taller (corresponding to more prevalent values in the sample) or smaller (corresponding to values which were more rare in the sample). We can compare across categories, or even back solve for the entire frequency distribution.</p>

<p>Whenever we present a descriptive statistic, be that a numerical summary or a graphical summary, it is always worth asking the question: “what are we trying to highlight?” In the case of frequency distributions, we are typically thinking about highlighting the total counts and cross category comparisons of the different values. Often times these are comparisons that we wish to make and using a bar chart for this is quite effective. However, depending on what we are trying to communicate, there may be alternative choices that make sense to make. It is always important to ensure that your visualization or summary is informed by the goal of your presentation, rather than by outside guidance. Descriptive statistics is fundamentally a field predicated upon communication. With that said, any time that we are presented with an observed qualitative variable, the frequency distribution completely contains all of the information in the data. It may not always be the most useful presentation of the data, however, it is a way of summarizing everything that we know about that variable alone. As a result, deep comfort with frequency distributions will be instrumental to effective communication and description of qualitative data.</p>

<p>Where our approach for qualitative data was to first summarize the data numerically, and then analyze, with quantitative data the first step is unnecessary. When our data are numeric to begin, we can work directly with them in order to begin to summarize the behaviour of the observed variables. Despite this change in process, the frequency distribution remains an impactful concept in summarizing and describing data which have been observed.</p>
<section id="the-frequency-distribution-for-quantitative-variables" class="level3" data-number="11.3.1">
<h3 data-number="11.3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-frequency-distribution-for-quantitative-variables"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.1</span> The Frequency Distribution for Quantitative Variables</h3>
<p>If the quantitative variables that have been observed are discrete, the frequency distribution can proceed in an exactly equivalent way as in the qualitative case. If, however, we have quantitative variables our frequency distribution needs to be adjusted. The issue is that, if a variable of interest is continuous, we do not expect to ever observe the same value more than once. This renders the frequency distribution to look something like a broken comb<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, rather than having any interesting features. To avoid this happening, we consider the process of <strong>binning</strong> quantitative variables, where values are placed into <strong>bins</strong> or <strong>classes</strong>, consisting of intervals, in order to better understand the structure of the frequency distribution.</p>
<div id="def-data-binning" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.2 (Data Binning)</strong></span> Data binning is a (pre-processing) step of a data analysis in which quantitative variables (typically continuous ones) are placed into <strong>bins</strong> or <strong>classes</strong> based on their underlying value. If a quantitative variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> takes values in the interval <span class="math inline">\([a,b]\)</span>, then the interval <span class="math inline">\([a,b]\)</span> is divided into several sub-intervals, say <span class="math inline">\([a,p_1], [p_1, p_2], \dots, [p_{k-1},b]\)</span>. Then, each observed value for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> is placed into its corresponding bin, before the data are analyzed.</p>
</div>
<p>As a general rule, bins should be selected either based on some subject-matter justification (such that they are meaningful to the underlying data), or else to accurately balance the trade-offs of smoothness and accuracy in the frequency distribution. That is, we want to select enough bins so that the true behaviour of the data are correctly represented, while not selecting so many that noise and variability are the primary conclusions to be drawn from the summaries. Plenty of methods to select the number of bins have been proposed, and in most software packages for devising frequency distributions various techniques will be implemented. It is worth ensuring that the technique selected for any particular use case accurately summarizes and describes the available data. Generally, <span class="math inline">\(10-30\)</span> bins will likely suffice, though fewer or more may be necessary in certain situations.</p>
<p>The only hard-and-fast rules of binning is that, first, bins should<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> be of equal width. That is, if you take <span class="math inline">\([0,1)\)</span> to be the first bin in your data, then every bin should be of length <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Second, bins should<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> span the complete range of your observed data. If you have points ranging from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span>, every value between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span> should be contained in some bin. Once binned, quantitative frequency distributions can be described in exactly the same manner that qualitative were.</p>

<p>While the tabular representation of the frequency distribution for quantitative variables is a relevant summary, and one which serves a key role, we will see that there are far more ways of summarizing the behaviour of quantitative variables. Before that, however, it is worth determining how to graphically represent a quantitative frequency distribution, through the use of histograms.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-histograms-for-visualizing-quantitative-frequency-distributions" class="level3" data-number="11.3.2">
<h3 data-number="11.3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-histograms-for-visualizing-quantitative-frequency-distributions"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.2</span> Using Histograms for Visualizing Quantitative Frequency Distributions</h3>
<p>If we expand the idea of a barplot to quantitative variables, we get the <strong>histogram</strong>. A histogram is primarily useful for displaying the distribution of a single quantitative variable. To do so, the horizontal (x-axis) represents the value of the variable of interest, and the corresponding vertical (y-axis) represents the frequency with which that value occurs in the data. That is, higher points correspond to more frequently occurring values, and lower points correspond to less frequently occurring values.</p>
<p>If the data are binned, then the histogram displays counts within the bins rather than at the values themselves. Just as with a barplot, the graphic proceeds by drawing a rectangle, with a height equal to the frequency, and a width equal to the length of the interval. The larger the rectangle, the more points that were observed in that range.</p>
<p>Sometimes, instead of having the y-axis measure the frequency, we may take it to measure the <strong>density</strong> of falling in that range. The density is given by the probability that a value in that range is observed, divided by the width of the range. For instance, if <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> observations fell between <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, then the height of the rectangle using the density representation would be <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{10/50}{4-2} = 0.1\)</span>. So long as every bin has an equal width, the same relative heights will occur whether using the frequency or density versions.</p>
<p>A key difference between histograms and barplots is that, since the data in a histogram are numeric, we typically consider the x-axis to be continuous. This means that the bins of the histograms expand along the complete axis, and adjacent bins will touch one another. In a barplot there is separation between these categories since there are no values between the two of them.</p>

<li>Both plots demonstrate that the most frequent order totals are comparatively low, with values around <span class="math inline">\(\$1.00\)</span>.

It would be interesting to look at, for instance, the prices of various items at the store to see if there was a reason for the peaks: otherwise, it could be seen to be random variation that is not particularly noisy. Sadie’s pattern, by contrast, is far more explicable, but it gains this by smoothing over a lot of the fine details within the graphic. Perhaps a graph that balances these two would be more suitable.</li>

<p>A histogram is a useful graphical display since it succinctly summarizes the entire distribution of a particular variable. You can easily see the range of the data, the points which came up frequently in your observations, those which were rare, and how this behaviour is expressed throughout. It will allow you to readily view points that appear to not fit the trend of the rest of your data, and to investigate a single variable at a glance.</p>
<p>When constructing a histogram, the primary decision that needs to be made is how many bins you should use, or equivalently, how large your bins should be. As you have more and more observations you can typically get away with using smaller bin sizes as, even at the smaller sizes, you likely still have observations that fall into the given intervals. Just as with the discussion on data binning, software that implement histogram construction often provide several techniques for choosing a bin size, or the number of bins, in order to best summarize the data. It is worth considering these for the problem at hand, and ensuring that the choice that is made illustrates the data faithfully.</p>

<h3 data-number="11.3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="characteristics-of-the-frequency-distribution"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.3</span> Characteristics of the Frequency Distribution</h3>
<p>While we will typically focus on graphically displaying the distribution of a dataset, it is useful to consider what it is specifically that we are trying to display, and what are the properties of a dataset which are of interest to us? We are primarily concerned with three properties of a distribution: the location, the spread, and the skewness. We have seen all three of these concepts when discussing random variables, but their importance becomes central when summarizing data. More concretely, when describing data we want to make sure to describe the <strong>shape</strong> of the distribution, the <strong>centre</strong> of the distribution, and the <strong>spread</strong> of a distribution. Each of these three concepts have different measures or components which, when taken together, serve as a more complete description of the frequency distribution.</p>
<div id="def-shape" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.3 (Shape (of a Distribution))</strong></span> The shape of the data distribution refers to the general pattern of points that are observed in the specific dataset. Typically, the shape of a distribution is decomposed into the <strong>modality</strong> and <strong>skewness</strong> of the distribution.</p>
<p>The modality refers to the number of peaks that are visible in the distribution: points that are higher than the surrounding points. A distribution is unimodal with one peak, bimodal with two peaks, or multimodal with more than two.</p>
<p>The skewness corresponds to how symmetric (or not) a distribution is. If a distribution can be mirrored around its center, with the same behaviour above and below the central point, we describe it as symmetric. If a distribution has differing tail-behaviour, extending out in a direction, we say that it is skewed. A distribution that has a long-tail to the right is called <strong>right skewed</strong> or <strong>positive skewed</strong>, where a distribution that has a long-tail to the left is called <strong>left skewed</strong> or <strong>negative skewed</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>To describe the shape of a frequency distribution, we describe the modality and the skewness of it. These two features combine to give a good sense of the general picture of the distribution, such that someone should be able to sketch a reasonable approximation to the frequency distribution from the description. However, there are many distributions with the same modality and skewness, which are otherwise quite distinct. To understand these differences, it is useful to turn towards measures of location, or central tendency, and measures of spread, or variability.</p>
<div id="def-location-descriptive" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.4 (Location (Central Tendency))</strong></span> The location of data, also referred to as the central tendency, is a description of where observations in the dataset tended to fall around. This can be measured as the sample mode, the sample median, or the sample mean, and is typically summarized using all three. Measures of central tendency give a sense as to where the middle of the data were, where various definitions of middle can be used.</p>
</div>
<p>Just as with random variables, measures of location come about by asking what we “expect” to see in the data. When we are discussing samples, rather than random variables, we are instead answering questions around what we saw on average, or what we tended to see in the observed data. Location summaries are quite common, and quite intuitive. You may indicate the most common value, which is the sample mode, or the overall average, the sample mean. However, just as with random variables, the measures of central tendency only tell a partial story. The other key feature of the data is the spread.</p>
<div id="def-spread" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.5 (Spread (Variability))</strong></span> The spread of data is a measure of how separated the data are, and how they tend to be spaced around the location. The spread can be captured using particular measurements, such as the sample variance, sample IQR, or sample range as was done with random variables. The may also refer to the tail behaviour of the data, which looks at how likely values are as they move further and further from the center of the data.</p>
<p>A distribution is said to be <strong>heavy-tailed</strong> if points that are far from the measures of central tendency are quite frequent in the data, and is said to be <strong>light-tailed</strong> otherwise. These concepts can be formalized more rigorously, however, it is often taken to be an informal rather than formal check.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>The spread of the data gives a measure as to how concentrated (or not) the observations were. Data which are widely spread out will have large measures of variability compared to those which are less spread out. When combined with the measures of central tendency, as well as a description of the shape of the distribution, it is possible to develop a fairly clear picture of the behaviour of the data, summarized rather succinctly.</p>

<h3 data-number="11.3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-shape-of-a-distribution"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.4</span> The Shape of a Distribution</h3>
<p>As indicated, the shape of a distribution is primarily defined by the modality and skewness of the distribution. That is to say, when asked to describe the shape of the distribution, you should report on the modality (including the values of the modal points), as well as on the symmetry or skewness of the distribution.</p>
<div id="def-modality" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.6 (Modality)</strong></span> Modality refers to the number of <strong>local</strong> peaks that a frequency distribution has. That is, the number of times that there are values in the frequency distribution that are higher than those in close proximity to them. If looking at the histogram we are looking for the number of “hills” that exist. Modality is classified by the number, and values, of the different modal points.</p>
<p>A distribution with one local maximum is considered <strong>unimodal</strong>. A distribution with two local maxima is considered <strong>bimodal</strong>. A distribution with three or more local maxima is considered <strong>multimodal</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to emphasize that a frequency distribution may have only one mode, but may be multimodal. That is, we do not require each of the peaks to tend to equate to exactly the same level to be considered peaks. Instead, we compare them to only the points that are around them. This way, we can capture the idea of <em>local behaviour</em> indicating that certain regions appeared more frequently than others around them, which is often of direct interest to us. It is also important to recognize that, if reading modal points from a histogram, the number of breaks and the number of observations will likely change the perception of the modality. There will often be judgment calls when discussing the number of modes that a histogram exhibits, with reasonable disagreement being possible. As a general rule, you should not consider small noisy peaks adjacent to others to be additional modal points, unless there is a good reason to do so. If you envision drawing a smooth line over the full distribution of data, the modal points will come where you draw the crests of the hills.</p>

<p>Beyond modality is the skewness. Skewness, or conversely, symmetry is a way of describing the <strong>tail behaviour</strong> of a distribution. As you move away from the central values, the most common values, or the middle values of a distribution, the tails are the values that are far from where you started but still present in the data. In general, if the tails going to the positive and negative directions look similar, the data are said to be symmetric. Otherwise, the data are said to be skewed. We differentiate skewness based on the direction that the tail travels.</p>
<div id="def-skewness" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.7 (Skewness)</strong></span> Data which are nonsymmetric are said to be skewed. The lack of symmetry can be identified by the behaviour of the tails of a distribution, differentiating between <strong>positive</strong> (or right) skew and <strong>negative</strong> (or left) skew.</p>
<p>Data are right-skewed if the tail is longer to the righthand side of the figure. Data are left-skewed if the tail is longer to the lefthand side of the figure.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes skewness is quite dramatic, being very evident in which direction the skew will be. In other cases the data are not symmetric, but are also not evidently skewed. In these settings it is worth investigating the data in slightly more depth to try to understand whether the lack of symmetry (or skewness) can be explained based on some particular values, and if the remaining data exhibit a more predictable pattern.</p>

<p>As a result, when asked to identify the shape of a distribution, you are being asked about the key features of the distribution: how many modal points are there, and where are those located, and what is happening with the tails of the distribution? Beyond these points, discussion of the shape of the distribution largely centers around giving added context to the nuance with the provided descriptors. For instance, if the skewness is not partiuclarly pronounced, that can be discussed. If modal points are not clearly delineated, that should be acknowledged. Once described, an individual should be able to sketch out a rough distributional curve that approximately mirrors the behaviour of the frequency distribution.</p>

<li>The distribution is approximately <strong>bimodal</strong>, with modal points at approximately <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span> minutes. The distribution is non-symmetric, since higher frequency of goals are scored near the end of the game than at the beginning, making it a left-skewed distribution. If the final bin is ignored, which may be reasonable given that the final minute of game has different dynamics than other times, the distribution appears roughly symmetric.</li>
<li>This distribution is approximately <strong>multimodal</strong>. The modes occur at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span> minutes. Every period starts with a faceoff, and as a result, every game will have faceoffs taken at exactly <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span> minutes into it. There are some points which may be described as modal points around <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> minutes and around <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> minutes, but these are far less obvious than the other three. The distribution is non-symmetric owing to the lack of a modal point at <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span> minutes. Because of this, we may say that there is a slight positive skew to the distribution. It seems more sensible, however, to indicate that in the absence of the three modal points that are clearly explicable, it is a roughly symmetric distribution that is approximately uniform across the whole range.</li>
<li>The modality of the penalty timings is difficult to describe. It may be reasonable to describe this as multimodal with modes appear around <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(38\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(45\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span>. However, this may also represent some histogram noise that is better to smooth over. In that case, perhaps you suggest that the three modal points are around <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span>, and around <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span>. The distribution does not exhibit perfect symmetry, owing to the spike near the end of the games, however, there seems to be little apparent skewness in the distribution. With the points near the end of the game removed, it is a mostly symmetric plot, however, with those points in there is some negative skewness indicated.</li>
<li>While the first two distributions are fairly clear to describe in shape, the penalties are a lot less evident. This becomes even more apparent when we consider how the number of bins selected impacts the overall shape of the distribution. Consider the following histograms (if online, you can click to enlarge them). With few bins, this distribution appears to be approximately symmetric with a single mode in the middle of the distribution. As more and more are added, the pattern remains rather similar until a within-period distribution emerges: the first period has a negative skew, unimodal distribution, the second a fairly uniform symmetric distribution, and the third a bimodal negative skew distribution. As we continue to add bins we see histograms that look similar to the one we considered, before getting to a point that looks more or less consistent throughout the range, with seemingly random spikes at various times. These demonstrate the importance of bin size selection, and illustrate the challenges that can occur when trying to describe real-world data.</li>

<h3 data-number="11.3.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measures-of-location"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.5</span> Measures of Location</h3>
<p>The shape of a distribution is described in fairly general terms. If you know that a distribution is right-skewed and unimodal, with a peak around <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, there are many plausible distributions that could be drawn for what this would look like. While often times this shape captures the most pertinent information for a distribution, sometimes we require more. To add specificity, we can consider the location or central tendency of a frequency distribution. The main measures of location are the sample mean, sample median, and sample mode. These correspond to the exact quantities that we saw in random variables, this time computed on the data directly.</p>
<div id="def-sample-mode" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.8 (Sample Mode)</strong></span> The sample mode is the most common value observed in a dataset. When there are more than one value which appear equally often, these are all consider modes. If a variable is binned, we may define the mode in terms of the classes rather than the specific value, depending on the context.</p>
</div>
<p>Whichever value appears most often is given as the mode. This is analogous to the most probable value for a random variable. The sample mode and the modal points are related to one another. When discussing modality, we contented ourselves with approximations, considering values <em>near</em> the actual modal points when defining the peaks. When discussing the sample mode we are looking for a specific value, or a specific category of values, which actually gives the most frequent value.</p>
<div id="def-sample-median" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.9 (Sample Median)</strong></span> The sample median is the middle point after ordering the observed data. If there are an even number of observations it is the mean between the two middle points. If we order the observed data as <span class="math inline">\(x_{(1)} \leq x_{(2)} \leq \cdots \leq x_{(n)}\)</span>, then the median is defined as <span class="math display">\[\text{Median} = \begin{cases}
    x_{([n+1]/2)} &amp; n \text{ is odd}; \\
    \dfrac{1}{2}\left(x_{(n/2)} + x_{(n/2 + 1)}\right) &amp; n \text{ is even}.
\end{cases}\]</span> That is, it is the middle point when there is an odd number of observations in the data, and it is the average of the two middle points when there are an even number of observations.</p>
</div>
<p>The sample median has the same interpretation as the population median we previously saw. There will always be <span class="math inline">\(50\%\)</span> of the observations which are less than or equal to the median, and always $50% of the observations which are greater than or equal to the median. This puts the median as the center of the distribution, when measured in terms of frequencies.</p>
<div id="def-sample-mean" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.10 (Sample Mean)</strong></span> The sample mean is the standard arithmetic average. If we observe <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\dots,x_n\)</span>, then we write the mean as <span class="math inline">\(\overline{x}\)</span>, and this is calculated as <span class="math display">\[\overline{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The mean is a very commonly reported measure for the center of a distribution. it is also referred to as the average. Just as with random variables and the expected value, the mean can be viewed as balancing the mass of observations. If you place equal mass at each of the observations, then the mean would be the point which balances a seesaw holding those masses.</p>

<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 11.8 (Charles’ Penguin Bill Lengths)</strong></span> Continuing on in day-dreaming adventures at the Palmer Station in Antarctica, Charles envisions recording the bill lengths of a random sampling of the penguins that are observed. These day-dreamed values are recorded, and Charles would look to summarize the general behaviour of these points, considering the measures of central tendency of them.</p>

<p>The three common measures of central tendency will often be explicitly computed and reported when access to the data is directly available. These can also be approximately indicated using a histogram of a frequency distribution. The mode will be the bin with the highest frequency, or equivalently, the highest point on the histogram. The median will be found in the bin which contains the middle observation. This can be challenging to find exactly without counting, but an approximation is likely possible. The mean will be found in the bin which balances the mass of the distribution. You can imagine asking yourself: where would the fulcrum need to go in order to balance a seesaw with these weights on it. The answer will tell you where the mean is. Note that this process, without explicit observations, will not be exact. Instead, it is in our interest to attempt to find approximately correct solutions to these questions, getting a general sense of the measures of central tendency from a graphical representation.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that, for each of these quantities, when computed on a dataset, we refer to them as <em>sample</em> measures. That is, we call the mode the <strong>sample mode</strong>, the median the <strong>sample median</strong>, and the mean the <strong>sample mean</strong>. This terminology emphasizes that our calculations are not with respect to a theoretical random variable with some assumed probability distribution, but rather from a sample of data that was actually observed. Recall that we view our sample as being <strong>realizations</strong> of a random quantity, either as a random process or from a larger population. That is, we can think of these measures as <strong>statistics</strong> computed on a sample, rather than the <strong>parameters</strong> that could be computed on the population.</p>

<h3 data-number="11.3.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measures-of-spread-or-variability"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.6</span> Measures of Spread or Variability</h3>
<p>When we introduced the concept of the expected value, and other measures of location of a random variable, we indicated that these would be insufficient to accurately summarize the behaviour of a random quantity. The same is true of a frequency distribution. Once again, by complementing the measures of central tendency with measures of spread, we are better able to understand the data which were actually observed, and use this to inform our understanding of the data. Combining variability, with central tendency, and distributional shape gives a good overall picture of what was observed, in a digestible summary form. The primary measures of variability for a dataset’s distribution are the same quantities used to measure variability of a random variable: the (sample) variance, (sample) IQR, and (sample) range.</p>
<div id="def-sample-range" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.11 (Sample Range)</strong></span> The sample range is the observed range in the data set. We define the sample range to be the difference between the maximum observed data point and the minimum observed data point. That is, if the ordered data is observed as <span class="math display">\[x_{(1)} \leq x_{(2)} \leq \cdots \leq x_{(n)},\]</span> then the sample range is <span class="math display">\[\text{Range} = \max\{x\} - \min\{x\} = x_{(n)} - x_{(1)}.\]</span> Just as with the range of a random variable, the range may be reported as either the distance between the minimum and maximum, or else as the minimum and maximum points themselves.</p>
</div>
<p>Just as with random variables, the sample range gives a rather coarse view of variability within a datset. The sample range does give information regarding the values that are <em>possible</em>, based on what was observed within the data, but it does not necessarily provide a reasonable representation of which values were commonly expressed throughout the data. A single outlying point can drramatically impact the range, without meaningfully changing the observed patterns. For this reason, we will often consider the sample IQR instead.</p>
<div id="def-sample-IQR" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.12 (Sample Interquartile Range (IQR))</strong></span> The sample interquartile range is the difference between the first and third quartiles in the dataset. That is, it is the length that spans the middle <span class="math inline">\(50\%\)</span> of observations within the variable. The sample IQR is computed as <span class="math inline">\(\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(Q3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q1\)</span> are the third and first quartiles.</p>
<p>In order to compute <span class="math inline">\(Q1\)</span> you compute the median of the first half of the data. In order to compute <span class="math inline">\(Q3\)</span> you compute the median of the second half of the data. If there are an odd number of points, the central point is computed in both. That is, taking <span class="math display">\[x_{(1)} \leq x_{(2)} \leq \cdots \leq x_{(n)},\]</span> then for the first quartile, <span class="math display">\[Q1 = \begin{cases}\text{Median}\{x_{(1)}, x_{(2)},\dots, x_{(n/2)}\} &amp; n \text{ even} \\ \text{Median}\{x_{(1)}, x_{(2)}, \dots, x_{([n+1]/2)}\} &amp; n \text{ odd}\end{cases}.\]</span> The third quartile, <span class="math inline">\(Q3\)</span>, is computed similarly as <span class="math display">\[Q3 = \begin{cases}\text{Median}\{x_{(n/2+1)}, x_{(n/2 + 2)},\dots, x_{(n)}\} &amp; n \text{ even} \\ \text{Median}\{x_{([n+1]/2)}, x_{([n+1]/2+1)}, \dots, x_{(n)}\} &amp; n \text{ odd}\end{cases}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The interquartile range has the same benefits when compared to the range in a sample as it did for random variables. Outlying points that substantially deviate from the trends that are actually observed do not make a large difference on the sample IQR, where they will on the sample range. This can be desirable for understanding the variability in <em>most</em> of the data. Just as with random variables, the range and IQR are analogous in that they give a full representation of how spread out the data are. It is also possible to conceive of variability as how far from <em>average</em> data tend to be. For this, we consider the sample variance (and standard deviation).</p>
<div id="def-sample-variance" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.13 (Sample Variance)</strong></span> The sample variance is an analogue to the population variance, measuring how far data are from the sample mean, on average. To compute the sample variance we take the following form <span class="math display">\[s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2.\]</span> Note that the division here is by <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> rather than by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Notice that if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is large, dividing by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> or by <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> will give roughly the same results.</p>
</div>
<p>The sample variance has the same underlying concern as the variance of a random variable: namely, it is a squared quantity. As a result, we will often consider the <strong>sample standard deviation</strong>, which is given by the square root of the sample variance, as an alternative representation of the sample variability.</p>
<div id="def-sample-sd" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.14 (Sample Standard Deviation)</strong></span> The sample standard deviation is an analogue to the population standard deviation, giving an approximate measure of the mean deviation from the sample mean, measured in the same units. The sample standard deviation is given by the square root of the sample variance, which is to say <span class="math display">\[\text{SD} = s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>These measures of spread are also useful to supplement the understanding of the behaviour of a dataset that is provided by the measures of central tendency. Specifically, by reporting measures of central tendency, alongside measures of spread, and a description of the shape of the distribution, you are able to describe and summarize the beahviour of a dataset in a concise manner in such a way so as to allow for a deep understanding of the patterns that have emerged.</p>
<div id="exm-compute-spread" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 11.10 (Sadie Questions the Spread in Bill Lengths)</strong></span> After having described the central tendency of the bill length data that Charles day dreamed about, Sadie inquires about the variability in the data. Charles, so focused on the penguins themselves, had not even stopped to consider how much variability may be present in these data. Sadie decides to help out by computing measures of sample variability.</p>

<li>For the sample variance, we first note that (from <a href="#exm-compute-central-tendency" class="quarto-xref">Example&nbsp;<span>11.8</span></a>), we know that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X} = 42.87\)</span>. Thus, we get <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}

<p>Histograms display a substantial amount of information for the entire observed distribution. They display the shape of the distribution, as well as the details as to which observations are likely or unlikely values, allowing this to be seen in one place. This amount of detail is often very useful, but on occasion it can obscure the larger picture. This becomes particularly apparent when we wish to compare the distribution of two different variables, or perhaps the same variable across two or more categories. In these situations, the numeric summaries that we have discussed end up holding more weight. While it is very often to report the mean along with the standard deviation, as the two values complement eachother well, it is also very common to report the so-called <strong>five number summary</strong> of a data.</p>
<div id="def-five-number-summary" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 11.15 (Five Number Summary)</strong></span> The five number summary is a method for reporting a set of descriptive statistics for a set of observed data. The five number summary consists of five numbers, listed in order. This is given by <span class="math display">\[\min(x), Q1, \text{Median}(x), Q3, \max(x).\]</span> That is, the five number summary reports the minimum, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value from a dataset. Doing so provides a succinct summary of both the location as well as the spread of observed data.</p>
</div>
<p>From the five number summary we also immediately know the range, and the IQR. While it is useful to specifically report the values of the five number summary, it can be even more effectively to display this graphically. Boxplots are a graphical display which leverage this idea. For a variable, the boxplot displays the minimum, the maximum, the median, as well as the first and third quartiles <span class="math inline">\(Q1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q3\)</span>, in ascending order, for a given variable. In order to do this, a box is drawn starting at <span class="math inline">\(Q1\)</span> and going up to <span class="math inline">\(Q3\)</span>. Then, the median is marked in the middle of this box. Extending from the box are the <em>whiskers</em>.</p>
<p>Each whisker is drawn out a length of <span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span> times the observed IQR, stopping at the highest (or lowest) point within that range. Thus, if all points fall within <span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span> times the IQR of either <span class="math inline">\(Q1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Q3\)</span>, then the whiskers will stop at the minimum or maximum point observed. If not, there are points beyond those included in the whiskers: these are typically referred to as outliers. The outliers are drawn beyond the whiskers of a boxplot, drawing a single dot for each point.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the boxplot is inspired by the five number summary, but it encodes slightly more information. It will be precisely the same whenever the maximum and minimum fall within <span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span> times the IQR of the first and third quartiles, but it will include further information in all other cases. This is done to indicate points which are <strong>outliers</strong>, those which appear to deviate from expected trends (of nicely behaved data).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Typically, the boxplots will be drawn so that multiple plots are shown on the same graph. In order to read a boxplot you can compare the medians, and then the spread. The typical variability of the quantity is contained within the box portion, and plots which have largely overlapping boxes are often thought to behave similarly. The whiskers represent the outer limits of what is expected within the data: if both whiskers are roughly the same length, the distribution appears to be mostly symmetric. If one is longer than the other, the distribution exhibits either positive or negative skew. The outliers can contribute to the illustration of skewness on the distribution, but are typically less representative of the distribution itself. A boxplot with a lot of outliers is suggestive of a dataset with far heavier tails than is typical for most well-behaved data, and any analysis on these data should proceed cautiously.</p>

Charles and Sadie begin to study these various boxplots, comparing the distributions illustrated by each of the boxplots, and trying to determine differences in observations.

<li id="fn1"><p>To get a glimpse into the world of graphical displays of information, used both well and poorly, it is worth a scroll through of two subreddits: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/" target="_BLANK">/r/dataisbeautiful</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/" target="_BLANK">/r/dataisugly</a>. While I do not universally agree with the categorization of these, a lot of the posts at least demonstrate the ways in which modern technology has expanded the potential for creativity.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Read more about this in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-florence-nightingale-changed-data-visualization-forever/" target="_BLANK">this Scientific American article</a>.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Read more about this in <a href="https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/4270_Cholera_outbreak_1854.html" target="_BLANK">this brief description</a>.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>There is some indication that, while the identification of the water pump lead to it being shutoff by the city, the cases of cholera were already reducing by this point. It is thus unclear whether the intervention was timely enough to be effective. However, the impact of the finding looms large to this day.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>For instance, if you are looking at measurements of some quantity over time, time can be used as a “numeric quantity”. If the data are geographic in nature, perhaps the locations of different events, then you can use geographic location (latitude and longitude) as numeric data, to place them on a map. These two ideas have been combined to create some very effective and compelling data visualizations. Notably, <em>1945-1998</em> is a work of art by Isao Hashimoto, which shows a time lapse video of every nuclear detonation between 1945 and 1998. The video, available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCF7vPanrY" target="_BLANK">YouTube</a> can be quite affecting. It is very heavy, and while I think a phenomenal representation of the way in which data can be conveyed effectively, please only watch if you are in a position to do so.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Recall from <a href="chapter4.html#sec-contingency-tables" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 4.5</span></a> a contingency table summarizes a frequency distribution in two or more variables.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>You can use other types of plots as well, such as pie charts. Most statisticians will be adamant in their disavowal of pie charts because they are typically pretty bad at doing what they set out to do.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Horst AM, Hill AP, Gorman KB (2020). palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data. R package Version 0.1.0. https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/. doi:10.5281/zenodo.3960218.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p><a href="..\graphics/ch11-broken_comb.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-6"><img src="..\graphics/ch11-broken_comb.png" class="img-fluid"></a><a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Almost always.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>Again, almost always.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Which is to say, we rely on the <em>vibes</em> of the tails, rather than their mathematical behaviour explicitly.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>For reference, NHL games are 60 minutes long (potentially longer if no one is winning at the end of the time), divided into 3 periods. When play is stopped, a face-off takes place to start the play again. Penalties occur when rules are violated by one of the teams. On the histograms, the start of the three periods are indicated in red dotted lines. These data come from a random sample of <span class="math inline">\(200\)</span> games during the 2022-2023 NHL regular season.<a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>This makes the sample variance <strong>unbiased</strong> for the true variance. If you conceive of the sample variance as a random quantity, one that depends on what sample you actually take, dividing by <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> rather than by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> will make it so that <span class="math inline">\(E[S^2] = \text{var}(X)\)</span>, where if you divide by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> this will not be the case.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>Outliers are a topic that necessitate a great deal of discussion to approach with care. As a general rule, I would be skeptical of any analysis you see which excludes outliers on the basis of a statistical test. Outliers, especially as assessed from these types of rules, are better understood as points that demonstrate that the data are heavy-tailed rather than points which should be ignored.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
