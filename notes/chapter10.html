<h2 data-number="10.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-probability-to-statistics"><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> From Probability to Statistics</h2>
<p>Until this point we have focused on the study of probability. At its core, probability is a subject which seeks to quantify the uncertainty present in statistical experiments. In the study of probability we begin by first making assumptions about the state of the world<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and from there we draw conclusions about what must be true about the state of uncertainty in the world. In this regard, probability answers questions of the form “if this is true about the world, what should we see?” For instance, if a fair coin is tossed <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> times, what is the likelihood that more than half of the tosses come up heads? We have made the assumption that we have a fair coin, tossed independently, and we wish to quantify our degree of uncertainty about this scenario.</p>
<p>This is not the only way that we could frame problems related to uncertainty. For instance, what if we asked “given the results from <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> tosses of this coin, do we believe that the coin is fair?” This inversion of the previous question starts from the observation of information from an experiment and asks questions about the underlying mechanisms that generated these data.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This type of question is addressed by the field of <strong>statistics</strong>.</p>
<div id="def-statistics" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.1 (Statistics (Field of Study))</strong></span> Statistics is the discipline in which data are collected, analyzed, and presented with the goal of understanding the mechanisms through which those data were generated.</p>
</div>
<p>In Probability we make assumptions about the world and calculate probabilities. These probabilities describe what we should expect to see if we were to observe the processes as they were assumed to exist. In Statistics, we collect information from statistical experiments, and use these data to infer what conditions were likely to have given rise to our observations. We are back solving for what set of assumptions are most plausible, given the observations. Uncertainty remains at the core of statistics. We will rarely be able to know <em>for certain</em> what different assumptions gave rise to the data that we observe, but instead look to clarify and quantify the ever-present uncertainty. Probability remains central to the study of statistics. Specifically, probability is the core tool for quantifying the ever-present uncertainty. Probability statements are the language of Statistics. As a result, the study of Statistics is largely the study of how we can take the set of tools that have been developed throughout the first part of these notes, and apply them in the reverse direction. Statistics gives us the tools that we need to make sense of the world around us. Statistics serves as a process for evaluating the quality of evidence and drawing conclusions from it. Statistics is the necessary area of study to draw informed conclusions from the information that we collect. Ultimately, it is Statistics which powers quantitative decision-making. Virtually every avenue of the modern world demands that we make decisions on the basis of incomplete or imperfect information, and through Statistics we can ensure that these decisions are as informed as possible.</p>

<h2 data-number="10.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background-and-data"><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Background and Data</h2>
<p>It is important to formalize some of the terminology upon which we will rely. A key challenge in formalizing these ideas is that, for many of these central concepts, we have an intuitive or colloquial sense of the idea. Just as with Probability, a large part of our goal during the early phases of learning Statistics revolves around connecting formalized ideas to intuitive concepts that we are familiar with from other contexts.</p>
<div id="def-data" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.2 (Data)</strong></span> Facts, figures, observations, or recordings in virtually any form (images, sounds, text, measurements) which are gathered and processed to form and communicate conclusions.</p>
</div>
<p>Data sit at the center of Statistics as the prime objects of study. We are concerned with how we can take data and draw valid conclusions. This may be by ensuring that the data are collected in a way which is suitable to draw conclusions, or by finding ways to graphically display the information within collected data, or by drawing inferences about the world using the data on hand. Data are the prime focus of Statistics. The data themselves are not particularly descriptive or actionable. Instead, the data are transformed into useful information through statistical techniques. We will broadly refer to any such process as a statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The goal of a statistical analysis can be placed into one of four categories. These categories define the four purposes of statistics.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong>: Descriptive statistics focuses on organizing and summarizing information. With descriptive statistics we seek to <strong>describe</strong> the current state of the world which lead to the data we have collected.</li>
<li><strong>Inferential statistics</strong>: Inferential statistics provides methods for drawing conclusions and quantifying the uncertainty surrounding these conclusions, with regards to a population or process response for the data collected. With inferential statistics we seek to <strong>infer</strong> the underlying truth about a population or process of interest.</li>
<li><strong>Predictive statistics</strong>: Predictive statistics provides methods for making predictions regarding the future behaviour of a process or population based on past observations from that population or process. With predictive statistics we seek to <strong>predict</strong> what is to come in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Prescriptive statistics</strong>: Prescriptive statistics provides methods for suggesting interventions into a population or process according to its likely impact on a chosen criteria. With prescriptive statistics we seek to <strong>prescribe</strong> interventions based on what is likely to happen.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 10.1 (Charles and Sadie Categorized Questions)</strong></span> Back out for coffee after a relaxing break, Charles and Sadie turn their attention to thinking about the possible use cases for Statistics. They begin to play a game, trying to identify which of the four major categories would be most appropriate to address their various questions of interest. For each of the following, identify whether the problem is best approached through descriptive, inferential, predictive, or prescriptive statistical techniques.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Charles wonders how many people, on average, visit the coffee shop each day.</li>
<li>Sadie wonders if the type of music playing in the shop impacts what purchases customers make.</li>

<p>Each of the various roles that statistics can play is defined in terms of <strong>populations</strong><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. We understand this at an intuitive level, and this intuition is strong place to begin to formalize Statistics.</p>
<div id="def-population" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.3 (Population)</strong></span> The collection of all individuals or items that are under consideration in a study or experiment.</p>
</div>
<p>In many settings, the population is a well-defined, concrete idea. We may think of all individuals who attend a particular university, all birds of a species living in a particular park, all cards of a particular model made last year at a given factory. In each of these cases we can envision taking all members of the population<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and placing them in one location. If we were able to do this, any questions we had about the population could be directly answered. This is not typically possible in these cases owing to practical considerations regarding the resources that would be required.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In many other settings, we cannot even imagine grouping the entire population of interest together, since the population is less concretely defined.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, investigating the quality of vaccines that are produced at a particular facility. This facility will continue producing vaccines indefinitely into the future, and we may wish to know about the set of these future items. Similarly, we may wish to understand the impact of a particular teaching style on children’s ability to learn math skills. In this case, we are not concerned with one particular school or one particular school board or one particular set of students. Rather we want to know how do children <strong>in general</strong> respond to this teaching intervention. In cases like these the population of interest is less concrete and more <strong>conceptual</strong>. It is not a specific well-defined group of individuals or items, and it may be possibly infinite. Instead of being able to collect all of the items of the population together we are only able to assess any individual or item and answer “is this a member of the described population?”. We refer to these as <strong>conceptual populations</strong>.</p>
<div id="def-conceptual-pop" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.4 (Conceptual Population)</strong></span> A set of individuals, items, or observations which are hypothetical in the sense that they do not tangibly exist as a concrete group, but instead share a common feature which defines the population. The units in the conceptual population are linked through the circumstances that they arise under resulting from conditions which are equivalent in some way. Sometimes conceptual populations are called <strong>hypothetical populations</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>The utility of a conceptual population is that it allows us to unify the framework of Statistics whether we are studying groups of people or objects that really do exist in front of us, or those which we can describe but not collect. Even something as well-defined as the population of a country, for instance, is a population which may be conceptual in many regards. There are constantly new individuals being born in the country, those who are dying, those moving to or away from it. Still, none of us are confused about what we mean by the “population of a country”. Likewise, conceptual populations in statistics are well-defined, even if they remain intangible.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our goal with statistics is to understand a population. However, as a general rule, we are unable to directly observe the entirety of the population. While it is typically infeasible to observe the entire population, we are often able to observe some units from the population. These units, when collected together, are referred to as a <strong>sample</strong>.</p>
<div id="def-sample" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.5 (Sample)</strong></span> A sample is a subset of a population which is observed, and as a result, information regarding these units is obtainable.</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, taken together we are interested in a particular population. We are typically unable to observe our population in full, and instead content ourselves with the capacity to view a subset of this population, which is referred to as a sample. Generally speaking, we are interested in some numeric quantities which describe the population. Perhaps we wish to know the average height of students in a school, or the total number of calls that are made at a company over a period of time, or the maximum litter size for a breed of house cats, or the proportion of defective units produced during a manufacturing run. In each of these situations, the question of interest relates to a quantity describing the population. If we were able to view the entirety of the population, we could simply compute the value of quantity. We refer to such quantities as <strong>parameters</strong>.</p>
<div id="def-parameter" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.6 (Parameter)</strong></span> A parameter is a numeric quantity of interest which is defined with regards to a population. A parameter captures the behaviour of the population. Typically the value of parameters will be unknown and unknowable.</p>
</div>
<p>The fact that parameters are generally unknowable is the central tension at the heart of many statistical problems. To resolve this tension we turn our focus towards quantities which can be computed, namely those which are derived from samples that we have taken. These quantities are aptly named <strong>statistics</strong>.</p>
<div id="def-statistics-quantity" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.7 (Statistics (Quantities))</strong></span> A statistic is a numeric quantity of interest that is computed on a sample. Any quantity which is calculated based on observed data from a sample is a statistic.</p>
</div>
<p>In this regard, Statistics as a subject is the study of statistics (as quantities). For instance, if we take the average height of a group of students, or the number of calls made by a selection of employees during a period of time, or the maximum size that a particular cat breeder has for a litter, or the proportion of defective products from a random selection of items sampled from a manufacturing run, each of these are statistics. Note that to differentiate a statistic from a parameter we are functionally differentiating between whether the quantity was computed on a sample or a population. There is no difference in the quantity itself, it is what the quantity is computed with respect to.</p>
<p>Thus, with these definitions we are able to concretely outline the process of statistics. We have interest in a particular population, conceptual or otherwise. Specifically, we have questions which are answered by parameters defined for this population. These parameters are unknowable since it is infeasible to observe all members of the population, and so instead we turn to taking observations for subsets of the population. These subsets are called samples, and samples are observable. Once observed, we are able to compute quantities of interest on the samples, referred to as statistics. It is our hope that somehow these statistics will be representative of the underlying parameters of interest, thus allowing us to answer the questions about the populations using information from the sample.</p>

<p>With this process outlined, we can revisit the roles that statistics will serve. Ultimately, our goal is to effectively use collected data<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> to discern and communicate information. We look to do this by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>describing</strong> the collected data, conveying the information that we have gathered;</li>
<li><strong>inferring</strong> conclusions about our population parameters from our sample statistics;</li>
<li><strong>predicting</strong> out-of-sample observations, based on the sampled ones; or</li>
<li><strong>prescribing</strong> interventions for the population to influence a parameter.</li>
</ol>
<p>The value in each of these applications stems from the capacity that we have to connect the sample to the population. As a result, much of our statistical focus centers on finding ways to ensure that our conclusions drawn from our sample are reflective of the overall population.</p>
<p>To understand how this is possible, consider an experiment which seeks to determine whether a particular coin is fair. Suppose that we toss it <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> times, and see <span class="math inline">\(54\)</span> heads. Is this a fair coin? While we cannot be entirely sure, this seems to be more-or-less in line with the number of heads that we would expect to see if the coin were fair. There is uncertainty present, but we can be more certain that this is a fair coin compared to our beliefs prior to running the experiment. Now imagine that instead of seeing <span class="math inline">\(54\)</span> heads on <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> tosses, we had seen <span class="math inline">\(94\)</span>. Immediately we should be skeptical that this coin is fair. It is perfectly possible that we see <span class="math inline">\(94\)</span> heads on <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> tosses of a fair coin<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, but it is not likely. It does not seem to be what we would expect to observe, and as a result, we are right to be skeptical of this.</p>
<p>This intuitive connection between what we can say about the population and the sample relies upon the sample being representative of the population. We would not take flips from another coin to be evidence of whether our coin is biased. We would not consider the sample to be particularly representative if instead of writing down every result, we ignored every time that more than one tail came up in a row. The intuitions we have about the relationship between our sample and our population rely on the assumption that the sample represents the population in some meaningful sense. Choosing a representative sample is, as a result, an important aspect of the statistical process.</p>

<section id="sampling" class="level2" data-number="10.3">
<h2 data-number="10.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sampling"><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Sampling</h2>
<p>Sampling is an area of study within statistics which focuses on the process through which units are recruited from the population into our sample. If the units we observe are biased in some way, or are inappropriately recruited, then it is immediately clear that conclusions drawn about the sample will not be transportable to the population. Imagine, for instance, that we are interested in the height of students at a university. If our sample contains only members of the basketball and volleyball teams, this will not be reflective of the heights of most students at the school. Our sample is unrepresentative. With sampling our goal is to select the sample in such a way so as to make guarantees about the information we learn from it, quantifying our uncertainty, and being relatively confident in our conclusions.</p>
<p>When we deal with populations which are conceptual in nature it may make less sense to think of sampling directly. For instance, it seems strange to think of our previous example of repeatedly rolling a die in the same manner that we think of recruiting students and measuring their heights. In the case where we wish to learn about a process rather than a concrete population, we will often frame the generation of our sample not through the language of <em>sampling</em> but rather through the language of <strong>experimental design</strong>. The design of experiments refers to the same set of factors that are considered for sampling: how can we ensure that the units we observe will be representative of the underlying population or process. However, with experimental design it is largely the case that we are in direct control of the types of factors that may lead our process to being unrepresentative. It is up to us to ensure that the units that are being generated, through the conceptual population, are representative of the units we are interested in based on the research question.</p>
<p>Our focus in this class will be on investigating several of the techniques used in sampling and experimental design to ensure that the samples we use are related to the population of interest in predictable ways. It will always be possible that, even following best practices and being very careful with our implementation, we end up choosing a sample or having experimental units which are nonrepresentative. This is uncertainty which is unavoidable in any scientific inquiry. Our goal then is to understand this uncertainty, to quantify it, and to ensure that we are able to understand precisely how big of a risk is this lack of representation, and how will that change the results we can report. We begin by describing techniques which can be used to ensure that samples are good representations for the populations of interest. In the next section, we will turn to the same types of considerations for experimental design.</p>

<p>When considering the process of data collection via sampling, the primary decision to make is on the <strong>sampling design</strong>. The sampling design refers to the strategy that is employed to decide which members of the population will comprise the sample. Some sampling designs will not result in valid or representative samples. The most straightforward sampling design, which, if applied correctly, will produce valid samples is simple random sampling.</p>

<p>Simple random sampling produces a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. Simple random sampling is far and away the most important sampling scheme. It is an effective way of drawing a representative sample itself, it is intuitive, and it forms the basis of many other, more complex sampling schemes. Generally, we can think of simple random sampling as <strong>sampling without replacement</strong>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Suppose we take our population to correspond to items in an urn, each labelled with the corresponding unit.

If desired, for any reason at all, it is possible to form a simple random sample <strong>with replacement</strong>, where in this setting the balls would be placed back into the urn after each selection. Whether the sample is to be formed with or without replacement, the same general procedure will be followed. Each member of the population will get assigned a numeric label (from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> through to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, the population size) and then software is used to select a subset of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of the labels.</p>

<p>There is an appeal in the simplicity of simple random sampling. Moreover, it is quite clear how, as long as enough units are sampled, simple random sampling will result in a sample which is representative of the overall population. Despite these benefits, there are some drawbacks that are not easily overcome in the simple random sampling paradigm. For instance, if you imagine a situation in which your sample is spread over a large geographic region, it is unlikely to be practical to form a simple random sample. Additionally, if you do not have a list of all population members, a simple random sample cannot be formed as described.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Another practical concern involves sampling in this regard when units have a natural ordering. Suppose that you are looking to test the impact of a new cancer therapy, and wish to form a sample of current cancer patients who will receive the experimental treatment to see if it improves over the current practice. If you form through simple random sampling it is possible that you will have only patients who are newly diagnosed or else only patients who have had their diagnosis for a long time. Neither situation is a particularly effective method for testing the therapy, and it becomes a large practice issue where you likely want to ensure that you have both sets of individuals represented in the sample.</p>
<p>To overcome these issues with simple random sampling, alternative sampling designs have been proposed. These alternatives can lead to more convenience in the sampling, and perhaps yield more accurate results than a simple random sample can. It is important to note that these alternative designs are only more effective when the design itself is taken into account when analyzing or describing the data.</p>

<p>One alternative design to simple random sampling, which is closely related, is known as systematic random sampling.</p>
<div id="def-systematic-rs" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.9 (Systematic Random Sampling)</strong></span> In systematic random sampling the sample is selected by choosing a random starting point from the list of members of the population, and then sampling every <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th member until the desired sample size is reached.</p>
</div>
<p>Systematic sampling forms a sample that looks like a simple random sample, but it is more straightforward to implement. If you want a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> from a population of size <span class="math inline">\(500\)</span>, then by selecting every <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>th member of the population, you will achieve the sample you desire. You want to be able to pick any individual from the population, and so you should randomly select the starting point before picking every <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>th member. Selecting every <span class="math inline">\(10th\)</span> individual is more straightforward administratively than generating random numbers and sampling those indices, particularly when there is a natural ordering of the individuals. However, there are some implementation decisions which need to be made, notably: what should <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be and who should be the first individual included? It is common to have the process of systematic random sampling described as follows.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Divide the population size, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, by the desired sample size, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and round the result down to the nearest whole number. This will be <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</li>
<li>Select a number, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, randomly between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. This will be the starting point.</li>
<li>Include in the sample <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m+k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m+2k\)</span>, and so forth until the last unit of the sample.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will generally form a usable sample, if its shortcomings are properly accounted for. However, it is not without its shortcomings as a procedure.</p>
<p>To understand why this can lead to issues suppose that we have <span class="math inline">\(N=7\)</span>, and want to form a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span>. Using this procedure we get <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>, as the result of rounding down <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{7}{3}=2.33\dot3\)</span>. Next, we select either <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> as our starting point. If we select <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> then we end up including <span class="math inline">\(\{1,3,5\}\)</span> and if we select <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> then we get <span class="math inline">\(\{2,4,6\}\)</span>. Note that in we will never select item number <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>, which means that there is no chance it is represented in our sample. This is a problem. There are plenty of ways to resolve this concern, some of which lead to other issues themselves.</p>
<p>One small modification that can made is to select <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N-(n-1)k\)</span>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> This will ensure that it is always possible to select up to the last unit. In our example with <span class="math inline">\(N=7\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span>, the starting point is selected from <span class="math inline">\(1,2,3\)</span> giving in addition to the two possibilities outlined above, <span class="math inline">\(\{3,5,7\}\)</span> as a third option. This alleviates the issues of not including some members of the population in any possible sample. When this technique is used, however, it is worth noting that some elements become more likely to be included than the others.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> This can be accounted for during analysis, but it needs to be completely understood to do so.</p>

<p>While systematic sampling can be a more straightforward method for implementing a sample that looks like a simple random sample, it is generally not going to alleviate concerns with (for instance) geographic separation. In this case the issue with either of the two aforementioned sampling schemes is that it they each would take substantial resources to send researchers to the area where the units to be sampled are. A remedy to this is to turn to <strong>cluster sampling</strong>.</p>
<div id="def-cluster-sampling" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.10 (Cluster Sampling)</strong></span> In cluster sampling individuals are grouped together into <em>clusters</em>.

</div>
<p>For instance, you may define clusters based on the geographic region that is occupied. This way you can ensure, for instance, that you only visit a set number of geographic regions, while still sampling enough individuals to collect useful data. A key criteria for cluster sampling to be valid is that each cluster should represent the overall population well. This can be an issue where members of a cluster are often more similar to one another than to members of other clusters. As a result, you can end up with an unrepresentative sample owing to the clustered nature of the sampling. In order to form a cluster sample, the procedure is essentially equivalent to simple random sampling. First, the population is divided into groups (clusters) which are labelled from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> through to the number of clusters that there are. Then, the clusters are randomly sampled, according to a simple random sample. Finally, all members of the selected clusters are included into the overall sample.</p>

<li>A major issue with this type of clustering is that homes that are on the same block are likely to be fairly homogenous.

<p>The major concern with cluster sampling is that, if the clusters are grouped together based on relevant information, the sample becomes predictably unrepresentative of the overall population. Because the clusters are often naturally formed based on a relevant factor (like geographic location), if this factor influences the topic that is being studied, the clustering design will influence the validity of the results. Still, cluster sampling, when done correctly, alleviates many of the difficulties with practically implementing a simple random sample.</p>
<div class="proof remark">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Remark</em> (Systematic Sampling as Cluster Sampling). </span>Mathematically, systematic sampling can be seen as a particular form of cluster sampling. To see this note that, once <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are defined, the set of individuals who are included in any given sample are completely defined and grouped together. As a result, you could preform these groupings of individuals, and treat those as clusters together. Then, instead of sampling individuals, you are sampling a cluster of individuals.</p>
<p>The key difference between cluster sampling and systematic sampling is that the clusters in systematic sampling are not typically naturally defined. There is not normally going to be a clear separation forming the groups in this way, and as a result, it may not be easier to run a geographically isolated systematic sample than it is to run a geographically isolated simple random sample. However, the understanding of equivalence mathematically is useful when data from these samples are to be analyzed as the tools from cluster random sampling can be put to use to validly analyze systematic data.</p>

<p>The key issue with cluster sampling is that natural clusters of individuals typically exhibit self-similarity. This is an issue when your sample is formed via complete clusters, however, it can be turned into a benefit to ensure a greater reliability of the sample itself. Exploiting this self-similarity leads to a sampling technique known as stratified sampling.</p>
<div id="def-stratified-sampling" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.11 (Stratified Sampling)</strong></span> In stratified sampling the population is divided into <em>sub-populations</em> known as strata. These strata should be comprised of groups of similar individuals. A simple random sample is formed within each strata, and each of the simple random samples are combined together to form the overall sample.</p>
</div>
<p>The major benefits of stratified sampling are two-fold. First, you will typically have more precision in your conclusions being drawn than from other sampling schemes. The reason being that individuals within a strata will be similar to one another, and so the variability that will arise based on which individuals are included is smaller than in other sampling schemes. Second, you are able to split your data into the different sub-populations describing results and conclusions for each group of individuals. This allows us to make conclusions both at the population level as a whole, but also at the sub-population level, which is often of direct interest.</p>
<p>To implement stratified sampling, you need to decide how many individuals will be sampled within each strata. A simple but effective way of doing this is to use <strong>proportional allocation</strong>. With proportional allocation the strata that are larger will have more members sampled than the strata which are smaller, which is a natural decision to make. To implement stratified random sampling with proportional allocation: 1. Divide the population into strata, based on a relevant and natural dividing criteria. 2. Within each strata, conduct a simple random sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(n\times\frac{N_j}{N}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the desired sample size, <span class="math inline">\(N_j\)</span> is the size of the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>th strata, and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the size of the population as a whole. This should be rounded to the nearest whole number. 3. Form the sample by including all members from each of the sampled strata.</p>

<p>While stratified samples are often the most efficient samples, statistically, they do not alleviate many of the practical concerns regarding simple random samples. In fact, in some cases, these issues may even be exacerbated. If, for instance, strata are formed on the basis of geographic location, then forming a stratified sample will guarantee that it is required to visit each geographic location. The sampling scheme which is selected should be concordant with the goals of the analysis as well as the restrictions and constraints that are at play.</p>

<p>In an experiment, experimental units are observed after having been given the treatment. The response variable is measured, and compared across the different levels of the factors (or across the different treatments) to determine how the various treatments impact the outcome.

<p>Just as there were many different schemes for constructing a sample, there are also many different experimental designs. We will explore two common designs, but it is useful to first understand the guiding philosophy of experimentation in Statistics. There are three key factors that ensure that data collected from an experiment are useful for drawing scientific conclusions.</p>
<p>First, is the idea of statistical control. It is not enough to know whether or not a particular treatment was followed by a positive response in the response variable. Instead, we require there to be some point of comparison. We call this point of comparison a statistical <strong>control</strong>. The idea is that we should always be comparing two or more treatments, even when our interest is in one particular treatment. If the treatment of interest is truly beneficial, we should be able to see this by comparison to other treatments. This way, we are able to ensure that the changes in the response variable that we see are related to our intervention, rather than by random chance. Sometimes we wish to see whether a particular treatment is effective, and there does not exist another treatment option that is a plausible candidate. In these cases, we often will take a treatment option to be “nothing at all”, which is to say no direct intervention on the given factor.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> In this way our control can still be used to see if our active intervention improves over doing nothing, when that is the alternative.</p>
<p>Beyond statistical controls, experiments rely on <strong>randomization</strong> and <strong>replication</strong>. With randomization the idea is that the treatment that each experimental unit gets should be be randomly selected, without consideration of the specific unit. This way unintentional selection bias can be avoided within the groups. For instance, in a medical study, if you end up giving the experimental treatment to patients who are otherwise healthier, then you may expect that the experimental treatment will produce better results not because it was more effective, but because the patients who received it are the ones who are expected to have better outcomes irrespective of treatments. In addition to randomization, replication serves a central role in experimentation. The experiment should be conducted on a sufficient number of experimental units to ensure that random noise does not cloud conclusions. In particular, the sufficient sample size will ensure that the groups created via randomization will truly resemble each other, and the more units in the study, the better able you are to discern differences which exist between treatments. These principles can be put to work across various different experimental designs, depending on the specific experimental setup and constraints that are at play.</p>

<h3 data-number="10.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="completely-randomized-design"><span class="header-section-number">10.4.2</span> Completely Randomized Design</h3>
<p>The key question when defining an experimental design is how do the experimental units get assigned to the various treatment options. The most obvious choice is to randomly assign each unit to one of the treatment options, ignoring any underlying factors about the units. This is considered a <strong>completely randomized design</strong>.</p>
<div id="def-completely-randomized-design" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.18 (Completely Randomized Design)</strong></span> A completely randomized design is one in which the experimental units are randomly divided into groups, one for each treatment in the experiment. The treatments are then assigned to each of the groups, randomly selected for each.</p>
</div>
<p>Typically we will consider an equal assignment of numbers of experimental units to each treatment option, though this is not strictly required. In the completely randomized design, we ignore anything that we may know about the experimental units beforehand.</p>

<p>Then, each of the groups gets assigned one of the treatments (low frequency/store bought/direct exposure; low frequency/store bought/indirect; low frequency/store bought/artificial; etc.). The treatments are given to the units, and then the heights are measured and recorded alongside the treatment that was assigned.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are at least two shortcomings of completely randomized designs which we may wish to overcome. The first is that, in a completely randomized design, we may not be able to understand the impact on subpopulations of interest. Because randomization occurs without consideration of any other factor it is also not possible to directly analyze how treatment may impact the outcome variable segmented by these factors. While this is often not the primary question of interest, it will often be the case that having answers to these types of questions is desirable. Second, a completely randomized design may be less efficient at capturing the true effect of treatment, when treatment is mediated by other factors. If some groups of experimental units respond more favourably<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> than others, ensuring that treatment allocation is split within these groups will lead to more precise estimates of the true treatment effect. As a result, we will often turn to more involved experimental designs to allocate treatment options.</p>

<p>When we wished to exploit the structure of a population in sampling, making use of systematic differences, we divided the population into groups called strata on the basis of these traits. We can do the same thing with our experimental units forming <strong>blocks</strong> of experimental units. This blocking procedure gives rise to the <em>randomized block design</em>, an alternative to a completely randomized design.</p>
<div id="def-randomized-block-design" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.19 (Randomized Block Design)</strong></span> A randomized block design assigns treatments randomly to all units within a block of experimental units.

</div>
<p>With the use of the block design, you are able to assess not only is there an overall impact of treatment on the response variable, but also is this impact of treatment impacted<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> through the blocking factor(s). This may be of scientific interest directly, and it also may help to ensure that random noise does not erode the ability to discern the true impact of treatment on the outcome.

<p>Whether data are collected via sampling or experimentation, it is important to ensure that statistical principles are followed so that the observed data are representative of the population of interest and useful for accomplishing the goals of the statistical analysis. There is a substantial amount of statistical work which goes into ensuring that data collection is valid. Once valid data have been collected, we must <em>do</em> something with them. As previously discussed, there are typically four use cases for data. In these notes, our focus is on description and inference. Before we can use the data to describe patterns or conduct inference, we must first develop a shared language around what data <em>are</em>. Some of this has been informally introduced throughout our discussions thus far, however, the formal definition remains important for ensuring the foundation for statistical analyses.</p>
<div id="def-variable" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 10.20 (Variable)</strong></span> A characteristic or trait that can vary from one observation to the next is called a variable.

<p>Generally speaking, we make observations of variables, and together this forms our data. We use the data to answer the questions of interest or conduct our analyses.

<p>Whether data are collected via sampling or via experiments, the data themselves are not particularly useful for insight. If you are presented with a large dataset, it will likely not be possible to directly interpret the data, or communicate a message. Instead, we need to take the data as input and convert them to more useful products. The remainder of these notes will focus on ways of doing this within statistics.</p>
<p>We will focus both on how to summarize and communicate data that have been collected, and then how to begin gaining insight from these data. These are the first two roles of statistics, as introduced before: description and inference. All of the roles that statistics plays build from the idea that we have been able to collect data which are somehow relevant and representative of the underlying population of interest. We investigate the data, describe what has been observed in the sample, or attempt to conduct inference not because we are interested in the data themselves, but because we hope that the data will be reflective of the population of interest. We are not primarily interested in the statistics that we calculate, but on what these statistics say about the parameters of interest.</p>
<p>It is important, as we begin to explore how we can use data directly, to keep in mind that the entire statistical enterprise relies on having high quality data available. This relies on having measured the factors that we care about, in ways that are meaningful. It relies on representative samples and well-designed experiments. Without adhering to the principles discussed throughout this chapter, statistics cannot proceed in a way which addresses our goals. High quality data is not a substitute for statistical analysis, but it is a prerequisite for it.</p>
