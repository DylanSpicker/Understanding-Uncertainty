              interpret statistical results. The authors emphasize how to:
              Apply statistical procedures, uncover the meaning of statistical
              research in terms of their practical applications, evaluate the
              validity of assumptions behind statistical tests, determine what
              to do when those assumptions have been violated, and meaningfully
              describe real data sets.",
