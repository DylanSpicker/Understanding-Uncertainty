Question
========
`r scenario` 

Possible responses range from `r min` to `r max`. Below are `r n` responses, ordered from smallest to largest.

> `r sort(observations)`

Suppose that there is a desire to have `r bin_count` bins in the frequency distribution. 

(a) What is the corresponding bin width? ##ANSWER1##
(b) What is the maximum value of the first bin? ##ANSWER2##
(c) What is the frequency of the largest bin? ##ANSWER3##
(d) What is the relative frequency of the `r scales::ordinal(bin_num)` bin? ##ANSWER4##

(Question ID: *`r id`*)
