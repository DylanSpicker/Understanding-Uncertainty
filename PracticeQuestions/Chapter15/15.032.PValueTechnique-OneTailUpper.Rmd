Question
========

`r qtext` a sample mean of `r format(mean, scientific=FALSE)` and a sample standard deviation of `r format(sd, scientific=FALSE)`.

a. What is the relevant value of the test statistic for testing the null hypothesis? ##ANSWER1##
a. What is the $p$-value calculated when running this hypothesis test? ##ANSWER2##
c. What is the conclusion from the hypothesis test, if $\alpha = `r alpha`$? 

##ANSWER3##

Question ID: *`r id`*

Answerlist
------------
* Based on the results, we can reject the null hypothesis.
* Based on the results, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
