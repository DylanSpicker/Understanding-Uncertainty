Question
========
A pharmaceutical company claims their new cholesterol-lowering medication reduces cholesterol levels by an average of at least `r reduction` points.  A clinical trial was conducted with `r n` patients to test this claim.  The sample mean reduction in cholesterol was `r mean` points, with a sample standard deviation of `r sd` points. Consider $\mu$ to be the average reduction in cholesterol level (such that higher values for $\mu$ represent larger reductions).

a. What is the critical value for the associated hypothesis test, at $\alpha = `r alpha`$?  ##ANSWER1##
b. What is the relevant value of the test statistic for testing the null hypothesis? ##ANSWER2##
c. What is the conclusion from the hypothesis test? 

##ANSWER3##

Question ID: *`r id`*

Answerlist
------------
* Based on the results, we can reject the null hypothesis.
* Based on the results, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
