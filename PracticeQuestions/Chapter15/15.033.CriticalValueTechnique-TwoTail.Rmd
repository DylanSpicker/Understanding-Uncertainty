Question
========
A biologist is studying the average lifespan of a particular species of beetle. Based on previous research, the average lifespan of these beetles is known to be `r avg` days. The biologist suspects that environmental changes in a specific region might be affecting the beetles' lifespan. They observe a sample of `r n` beetles from the specific region, finding an average life span of `r mean` days with a standard deviation of `r sd` days. 

a. What is the **magnitude** of the critical value for the associated hypothesis test, at $\alpha = `r alpha`$?  ##ANSWER1##
b. What is the relevant value of the test statistic for testing the null hypothesis? ##ANSWER2##
c. What is the conclusion from the hypothesis test? 

##ANSWER3##

Question ID: *`r id`*

Answerlist
------------
* Based on the results, we can reject the null hypothesis.
* Based on the results, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
