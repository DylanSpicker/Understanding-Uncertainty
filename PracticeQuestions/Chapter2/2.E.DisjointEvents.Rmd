Question
========
A cinema has $12$ screens, numbered $1$ through $12$. Before opening, an employee checks to ensure that the projectors are correctly calibrated. 

Consider the following events:

> `r event`

Are these events disjoint, or not disjoint?

(Question ID: *`r id`*)

Answerlist
----------
* Disjoint 
* Not Disjoint
