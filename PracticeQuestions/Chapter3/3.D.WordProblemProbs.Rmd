Question
========
`r scenario`: `r oA`, `r oB`, and `r oC`. 

Suppose that `r pA`% of `r unit`s `r verb` `r oA` and that `r pB`% of `r unit`s `r verb` `r oB`. 

Consider `r article` `r unit` that is randomly selected. 

a. What is the probability that the `r unit` is "`r oC`"? ##ANSWER1##
b. What is the probability that the `r unit` is not "`r oA`"? ##ANSWER2##
c. What is the probability that the `r unit` is either "`r oA`" or "`r oB`"? ##ANSWER3##
d. What is the probability that the `r unit` is both "`r oA`" and "`r oB`"? ##ANSWER4##
