Question
========
Let $`r eventA`$ be the event that a randomly selected university student has taken any course in `r subjectA`, and $`r eventB`$ be the event that a randomly selected university student has taken any course in `r subjectB`. 
Suppose that $P(`r eventA`) = `r pS`$, $P(`r eventB`) = `r pC`$, and `r given_prob_final`. What is the probability that `r event`? 

(Question ID: *`r id`*)
