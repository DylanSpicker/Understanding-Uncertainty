Question
========
Suppose that $X$ is a random variable representing `r value`, with a known mean of $`r mean`$ and standard deviation of $`r sd`$. 

`r extra_statement` A sample of size `r n` is taken.

a. What is the mean of the sampling distribution of $\overline{X}$? ##ANSWER1##

##ANSWER3## 

Question ID: *`r id`*

Answerlist
----------
