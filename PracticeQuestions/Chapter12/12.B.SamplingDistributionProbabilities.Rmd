Question
========
Suppose that you are told that the sampling distribution of `r what` is $N(`r mean`, `r variance`)$, based on a random sample of size $`r n`$. 

a. What is the probability that the calculated mean will exceed `r value`? ##ANSWER1##
b. If the sample size had been `r m` instead, what would the mean of the sampling distribution have been? ##ANSWER2##
c. If the sample size had been `r m` instead, what would the variance of the sampling distribution have been? ##ANSWER3##
d. Suppose that a sample of size `r m` is taken. What is the probability that the calculated does not exceed `r value2`? ##ANSWER4##
