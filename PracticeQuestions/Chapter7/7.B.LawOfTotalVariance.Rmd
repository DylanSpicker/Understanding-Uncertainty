```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}

# Give E[X], E[Y], E[Y|X], and var(Y|X)
EX <- sample(1:50, 1)
varX <- sample(1:50, 1)

a <- sample(2:50, 1)
b <- sample(2:50, 1)
d <- sample(2:50, 1)

EYgX <- paste0(a, "X + ", d)

# Variance of Y
varY <- a^2 * varX + (b * EX)

```


Question
========

Suppose that it is known that, for two random variables $X$ and $Y$, we have:

* $E[X] = `r EX`$.
* $\text{var}(X) = `r varX`$.
* $E[Y|X] = `r EYgX`$.
* $\text{var}(Y|X) = `r varYgX`$.

What is the variance of $Y$ (round your answer to 2 decimal points).
