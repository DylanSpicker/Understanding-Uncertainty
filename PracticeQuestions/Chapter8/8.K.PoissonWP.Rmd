Question
========
Suppose that `r event` occur at a rate of `r lambda` per `r timeframe_unit`. 

a. What is the probability that `r Xa` `r event_b` occur `r prep` a specific `r timeframe_unit`? ##ANSWER1##
b. What is the variance in the number of occurrences of `r event_b` per `r timeframe_unit`? ##ANSWER2##

Question ID: `r id`
