Question
========
There are a total of `r N` `r item` currently at a local `r location`. Of these, `r M` `r item` have `r condition`. Suppose that `r n` `r item` are selected at random.

a. How many `r item` should we expect to have `r condition`? ##ANSWER1##
b. What is the probability that, of those selected, exactly `r k` `r item` have `r condition`? ##ANSWER2##

Question ID: `r id`
