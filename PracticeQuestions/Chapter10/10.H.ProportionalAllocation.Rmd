Question
========
`r scenario`

In the population there are `r format(N1, scientific=FALSE)` `r groupA`, `r format(N2, scientific=FALSE)` `r groupB`, and `r format(N3, scientific=FALSE)` `r groupC`. 

Suppose the desired sample size is `r n`.

a. What should be the sample size of `r groupA`? ##ANSWER1##
b. What should be the sample size of `r groupB`? ##ANSWER2##
c. What should be the sample size of `r groupC`? ##ANSWER3##
