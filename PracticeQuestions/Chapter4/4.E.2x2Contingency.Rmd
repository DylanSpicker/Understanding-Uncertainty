Question
========
`r setup` 

A sample of size `r n` is taken, and summarized in the following contingency table. 

|            | `r h1`  | `r h2`  |
| :--------- | :-----: | :-----: |
| **`r r1`** | `r n11` | `r n12` |
| **`r r2`** | `r n21` | `r n22` |

a. What is the probability that a randomly sampled individual `r e1`? ##ANSWER1##
b. What is the probability that a randomly sampled individual `r e2`? ##ANSWER2## 
c. Given that a randomly sampled individual `r e1`, what is the probability that this individual `r e2`? ##ANSWER3##
d. Are `r ind` independent, when considering a randomly sampled individual? ##ANSWER4##

(Question ID: *`r id`*)

Answerlist
----------
* Yes, they are independent.
* No, they are not independent.
