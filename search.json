    "text": "What are these notes?\nThese notes were originally written to supplement the Winter 2024 offering of STAT 1793 at the University of New Brunswick on the Saint John campus. They have since grown into a more comprehensive resource, attempting to direct a path through introductory probability and statistics material, both for students in a Statistics program, as well those who require probability or statistics for their major. Owing to the wide range of possible audiences, not all sections of the notes will be relevant to all students. I have tried to clearly indicate requirements throughout the text.\nFurther, these notes remain a work-in-progress. There is additional material being added, old material being revised or clarified, and some restructuring going on. If at any point you have comments, questions, suggestions, or corrections to these notes, please do reach out!\nIn the writing of these notes, I am indebted to the numerous introductory texts that I have previously read, and the multitude of Statistics instructors that I have had the pleasure of studying with. As a result, I am certain that I have drawn inspiration from many sources for examples, exercises, or techniques of description. Where parallels with other work are explicit and intentional, those works are mentioned alongside the relevant passages. Where parallels are the result of internalized knowledge coming forth as inspiration, I am not able to draw direct connections. However, I will advise that the following books are all excellent resources, and each has played a part in my current approach to teaching statistics, either directly or indirectly. For introductory topics consider Engelhardt and Bain (1991); Navidi (2010); Mendenhall et al. (2013) among countless others. For problems, consider Bassett et al. (2000); Grimmett and Stirzaker (2001); Schiller, Alu Srinivasan, and Spiegel (2012).\nOne final note is that our coverage of concepts throughout reflects my personal biases and proclivities towards what is important in a sequence on probability and statistics. For instance, compared to others I may have a larger emphasis on probability. This is reflected both in the ordering of material (we start at Probability not at Statistics), and in the weight that each topic is given. It is my belief that you need to be able to fluently speak the language of probability in order to study statistics, and the notes begin with a strong focus on this. If these notes are being used in a two course sequence, it is my belief that the first term should consider almost exclusively probability, leaving statistical results for a second course.",

    "text": "Studying Statistics (and other quantitative subjects)\nTo successfully use these notes, I would recommend a several step procedure:\n\nWhen reading the material, or watching lecture videos, focus on developing your understanding. Statistics is not a subject that is predominantly memory-driven. It is not about remembering the facts, formula, or question types, it is about understanding how these all come together.\n\nIf you get lost along the way, ask questions.\n\nWhen you get to examples in these notes, do not look at the solutions directly. Instead, you should try to solve the examples yourself. If you get stuck, look at the solution, but only enough to see remove the current confusion, and then continue.\n\nThe process of learning statistics, and most quantitative subjects for that matter, relies on doing the work in these subjects.\nLooking at solutions will often undermine your own understanding. It is a much different process to look at a solution and understand why it is correct, than it is to determine a solution for yourself.\n\nComplete the practice questions.\n\nNote: struggling with problems is a key component of learning in any mathematical discipline. It is only by struggling to understand how the pieces fit together that you will develop a proper understanding for yourself.\n\nThroughout your study, make sure you are continually asking yourself how this fits together, how this confirms or contradicts what you already know, and how this may be used in your life beyond these pages.\n\nDrawing personal connections to the material is a very effective way of ensuring that it sticks better.\n\n\nThroughout the notes there will be references to computer code in a programming language known as R. R is the most common language used for statistics by practicing statisticians, and it is a great utility for many of the types of problems we will be considering throughout these notes. It is possible to pass through the notes without writing R code, however, familiarity with it will make the process of statistics far nicer to engage with. If you are using the web notes this code can all be run directly in the browser. If you are using the PDF notes, the code and output is still provided. In either case, I would suggest getting R running on your own device, if possible. It is free to download and install. I would also suggest installing R Studio, which is a program specifically designed for writing and running R code with a lot of nice features.",

    "section": "Some Mathematical Background",
    "text": "Some Mathematical Background\nThese notes require high school mathematics to complete. Some sections of the notes require calculus (limits, derivatives, and integrals). It is possible to pass through the core of these notes skipping any sections that specifically require calculus: these are noted in text. For all sections, the assumption is that you will be comfortable manipulating mathematical expressions, solving basic equations, using a calculator, and so forth. The following are a handful of topics which will come up throughout the notes that are assumed to be known, presented here in brief as a quick reference.\n\nLogarithms and Exponent Rules\nRecall that if \\(a^x = b\\), then we can solve for \\(x\\) through the use of logarithms. Specifically, \\(x = \\log_a(b)\\), where we read this as “the logarithm with base \\(a\\) of \\(b\\).” The expression means that “\\(x\\) is the exponent we put on \\(a\\) to get \\(b\\).” In these notes1 we use the notation \\(\\log(x)\\) to represent the natural logarithm. The natural logarithm is \\(\\log_e(x)\\), where \\(e \\approx  2.71828\\) is Euler’s number. The exponential function is given by \\(e^{x} = \\exp(x)\\). Which notation is used depends on the specific setting, but both are equivalent.\nRecall further the following exponent and log rules:\\[\\begin{align*}\na^b\\times a^c &= a^{b + c} \\\\\na^b\\times c^b &= (ac)^b \\\\\na^{-b} &= \\frac{1}{a^b} \\\\\n\\left(a^{b}\\right)^c &= a^{bc} \\\\\na^0 &= 1 \\\\\n\\log(ab) &= \\log(a) + \\log(b) \\\\\n\\log(a^b) &= b\\log(a) \\\\\n\\log(1) &= 0 \\\\\n\\log(e) &= 1.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nSummation and Product Notation\nIf we wish to add up a series of numbers, \\(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\) then we can use summation notation to record this. Specifically, \\[x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.\\] Here \\(i\\) is an indexing variable just used to keep track of which number we are currently working on. Note that the following quantities will hold \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i) &= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i) &= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n cx_i &= c\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can also use a similar shorthand to discuss repeated products. That is, if we want to multiply \\(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\), then we can write \\[x_1\\times x_2\\times\\cdots\\times x_n = \\prod_{i=1}^n x_i.\\] Again, \\(i\\) is used as an indexing variable to keep track of what value is currently being multiplied. The following results hold \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\prod_{i=1}^n x &= x^n \\\\\n    \\prod_{i=1}^n b^{x_i} &= b^{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} \\\\\n    \\prod_{i=1}^n cx_i &= c^n\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nOther Important Points\nThe following are some additional points that are useful to know, but which do not necessarily fit together nicely.\n\nFor any two values \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we get \\((x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\\).\nThe integers are the set of all whole numbers, \\(\\{0, \\pm1,\\pm2,\\dots\\}\\). We will often denote the set of integers using \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\nThe natural numbers are the set of all counting numbers, either \\(\\{0,1,2,3,\\dots\\}\\) or else \\(\\{1,2,3,4,\\cdots\\}\\) depending on the source. We often denote the set using \\(\\mathbb{N}\\).\nThe real numbers are the set of all numbers that you think of when thinking of numbers. They include the integers, and any fractions, and anything that cannot be written as a fraction (like \\(\\pi\\) and \\(e\\)) as well. We denote the real numbers as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nIntervals of real numbers are denoted as \\((a,b)\\) or \\([a,b]\\) (or a mixture, giving \\([a,b)\\) or \\((a,b]\\)). A round bracket means that the endpoint is not included in the set, where a square bracket means that it is. That is, a value of \\(x\\) is in \\((a,b)\\) if \\(a &lt; x &lt; b\\), where it is in \\([a,b]\\) if \\(a \\leq x \\leq b\\).\nWe write “\\(x\\) is in the interval \\((a,b)\\)” mathematically using the \\(\\in\\) symbol. Specifically, \\(x \\in (a,b)\\).\nInfinity (\\(\\infty\\)) is not a number. Rather, it is a statement regarding the lack of a bound. When we say that something is infinity, or infinite, we simply mean that it is larger than any of the natural numbers. If you were to be given any number, then infinity will be larger than that.\nLimits: note that, while limits are from calculus, they are useful for formally understanding a few concepts in class. The limit of a function, \\(f(x)\\), is simply the value that the function approaches as \\(x\\) approaches a specific point. So, for instance, \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)\\) is the value that \\(f(x)\\) approaches as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\). If \\(f(a)\\) exists then it is simply \\(f(a)\\). However, \\(f(a)\\) may not exist, at which point, we look at where the function is tending to.\nInfinite Limits: Of specific importance to us are infinite limits. Specifically, \\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\] captures the beahviour of the function \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) gets larger and larger. In many cases, \\(f(x)\\) will approach some specific value, which we assign to be the limiting value of the function.",

    "text": "1.1 What is Probability?\nAt its core, statistics is the study of uncertainty. Uncertainty permeates the world around us, and in order to make sense of the world, we need to make sense of uncertainty. The language of uncertainty is probability. Probability is a concept which we all likely have some intuitive sense of. If there was a 90% probability of rain today, you likely considered grabbing an umbrella. You are not likely to wager your life savings on a game that has only a 1% probability of paying out. We have a sense that probability provides a measure of likelihood. Defining probability mathematically is a non-trivial task, and there have been many attempts to formalize it throughout history. While we will spend a good deal of time formalizing notions of probability, we first pause to emphasize the familiarity with probability that you are likely starting with.\nSuppose that two friends, Charles and Sadie, meet for coffee once a week. During their meetings they have wide-ranging, deep, philosophical conversations spanning across many important topics.1 Beyond making progress on some of the most pressing issues of our time, Charles and Sadie each adore probability. As a result, at the end of each of their meetings, they play a game to decide who will pay. The game proceeds by having them flip a coin three times. If two or more heads come up Charles pays, and otherwise Sadie pays.2\nWe can think about the strategy that they are using here and feel that this is going to be “fair”. With two or more heads, Charles pays. With two or more tails, Sadie pays. There always has to be either two or more heads or two or more tails, and each is equally likely to come up3. The outcome of their game is uncertain before it begins, but we know that in the long run neither of the friends is going to be disadvantaged relative to the other. We can say that the probability that either of them pays is equal. It’s 50-50. Everything is balanced.\nNow imagine that one day, in the middle of their game, Charles gets a very important phone call4 and leaves abruptly after the first coin has been tossed. The first coin toss showed a heads. Sadie, recognizing the gravity of the phone call, pays for the both of them, while realizing that Charles was well on the way to having to pay.\nLooking at Example 1.1, we can see that Sadie should likely have not paid. Only one out of every four times would Sadie have had to pay, given the first coin being heads. However, we can not be certain that, had all three tosses been observed, Sadie would not have paid. It is possible that we would have observed two tails, making Sadie responsible for the bill. This possibility happens one time out of four, which is more likely than the probability of rolling a four on a six-sided die5. Fours are rolled on six-sided dice quite frequently6, and so it is not all together unreasonable for Sadie to have paid.\nThis seemingly simple concept is the core of probability. Probability serves as a method for quantifying uncertainty. It allows us to make numeric statements regarding the set of outcomes that we can observe, by quantifying the frequency with which we expect to observe those outcomes. Probability does not remove the uncertainty. We still need to flip the coin or roll the die to know what will happen. All probability gives us is a set of tools to quantify this uncertainty. These tools are critical for decision making in the face of the ever-present uncertainty around us.",

    "section": "1.2 How to Interpret Probabilities (like a Frequentist)",
    "text": "1.2 How to Interpret Probabilities (like a Frequentist)\nWe indicated that, intuitively, probability is a measure of the frequency with which a particular outcome occurs. This intuition can be codified exactly with the Frequentist interpretation of probability. According to the Frequentist interpretation (or frequentism, as it is often called), probabilities correspond to the proportion of time any event of interest7 actually occurs in the long run. For a Frequentist, you imagine yourself performing the experiment you are running over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. Each time you answer “did the event happen?” and you count up those occurrences. As you do this more and more and more, wherever that proportion lands corresponds to the probability.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: This plot simulates the repeated tossing of a coin. The x-axis represents the number of coins being tossed, and the y-axis plots the proportion of times that heads has shown up cumulatively over the tosses thus far. We can see in the long run that this proportion tends towards \\(0.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo formalize this mathematically, we first define several important terms.\n\nDefinition 1.1 (Experiment) Any action to be performed whose outcome is not (or cannot) be known with certainty, before it is performed.\n\n\nDefinition 1.2 (Event [Informally]) A specified result that may or may not occur when an experiment is performed.\n\nSuppose that an experiment is able to be performed as many times as one likes, limited only by your boredom. If you take \\(k_N\\) to represent the number of times that the event of interest occurs when you perform the experiment \\(N\\) times, then a Frequentist would define the probability of the event as \\[\\text{probability} = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\frac{k_N}{N}.\\] If you have never taken a calculus course, and thus are unfamiliar with the concept of limits, that is not a barrier to understanding this statement. When you see a statement of the form \\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x),\\] simply think “what is happening to the function \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) grows and grows (off to \\(\\infty\\))?”\nIn practice this means that, in order to interpret probabilities, we think about repeating an experiment many, many times over. As we do that, we observe the proportion of time that any particular outcome occurs, and take that to be the defining relation for probabilities. The reason that we say the probability of flipping a heads is \\(0.5\\) is because if we were to sit around and flip a coin8 over, and over, and over again, then in the long-run we would observe a head9 in \\(0.5\\) of cases.\n\nExample 1.2 (Probability Interpretation) How do we interpret the statement “the probability that Sadie would have had to pay, given a head on the first toss, is \\(0.25\\)”? Recall that in the game, they toss three coins, and Sadie pays if two of them show tails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis statement means that, if Sadie were to repeatedly be in the situation where one head has shown and there are two coins left to toss, then in \\(0.25\\) of these situations (in the limit, as this is repeated an infinite number of times) will end up showing two tails.\n\n\n\n\nMany situations in the real world are not able to be run over and over again. Think about, for instance, the probability that a particular candidate wins in a particular election. There is uncertainty there, of course, but the election can only be run once. What then? There are several ways through these types of events.\nFirst, we can rely on the power of imagination. There is nothing stopping us from envisioning the hypothetical possibility of running the election over, and over, and over, and over again. If we step outside of reality for a moment, we can ask “if we could play the day of the election many, many, many times, what proportion of those days would end with the candidate being elected?” If we say that the candidate has a 75% chance of being elected, then we mean that in \\(0.75\\) of those imagined worlds, the candidate wins. It is crucial to stress that in our imagination here, we need to be thinking about the exact same day over and over again. We cannot imagine a different path leading to the election, different speeches being given in advance, or different opposition candidates. If we start from the same place, and play it out many times over, what happens in each of those worlds?\nThis repeated imagining is not for everyone. As a result, alternative proposals to the interpretation of probability have been made, with the Bayesian interpretation (or subjectivist interpretation) being particularly prominent. To Bayesians, probability is a measure of subjective belief. To say that there is a \\(50\\%\\) chance of a coin coming up is a statement about one’s knowledge of the world. The Bayesian view, built around subjective confidence in the state of the world, can be formalized mathematically as well. A Bayesian considers the prior evidence that they have about the world10 and combine this with current observations in order to update their subject beliefs, balancing these two sources of information.\n\nRemark (Bayesian Probabilities and Belief Updating). Suppose that a Bayesian is flipping a coin. Before any flips have been made the Bayesian understandably believes that the coin will come up heads \\(50\\%\\) of the time. However, when the coin starts to be flipped, the observations are a string of tails in a row.\nAfter having flipped the coin five times, the individual has observed five tails. Of course, it is totally possible to flip a fair coin five times and see five tails, but there is a level of skepticism growing.\nAfter 10 flips, the Bayesian has still not seen a head. At this point, the subjective belief is that there is likely something unfair about this coin. Even though the experiment started with a baseline assumption that the coin was fair the Bayesian no longer believes that the next flip will be a head.\nAs this goes on, you can imagine the Bayesian continuing to update their view of the world. To them, the probability is an evolving concept, capturing what was believed and what has been observed.\n\nFor the election example, the Bayesian interpretation is somewhat easier to think through. To say that a candidate has a \\(75\\%\\) chance of winning the election means that “based on everything that has been observed, and any prior beliefs about the viability of the candidates, the subjective likelihood that the candidate wins the election is \\(0.75\\)”. If we disagree about prior beliefs, or have experienced different pieces of information, then we may disagree on the probability. That is okay.\nIn these notes, we focus on the Frequentist interpretation. This choice is not a strong stance on the relative merits of the two viewpoints. There is some research to suggest that Frequentist interpretations are fairly well understood by the general public 11. However, it is important to know and recognize that there is a world beyond Frequentist Probability and Statistics, one which is very powerful once it is unlocked.12\n\nIf probability measures the long term proportion of time that a particular event occurs, how can we go about computing probabilities? Do we require performing an experiment over and over again? Fortunately, the answer is no. The tools of probability we will cover allow us to make concrete statements about the probabilities of events without the need for repeated experimental runs. However, before completely dismissing the idea of repeatedly running an experiment, it is worth considering a tool we have at our disposal that renders this more possible than it has ever been: computers.",

    "text": "1.3 R Programming for Probability and Statistics\nThroughout these notes we will make use of a programming language for statistical computing, called R. Classically, introductory statistics courses involved heavy computation of particular quantities by hand. The use of a programming language (like R) frees us from the tedium of these calculations, allowing for a deeper focus on understanding, explanation, decision-making, and complex problem solving. This is not to say we will never do problems by hand13, however, these notes emphasize the use of statistical computing. The sections on R programming throughout the notes are self-contained, and separate from the main material. Studying these sections will give you familiarity and comfort with reading, modifying, and writing R scripts for statistical programming.\nWhen viewing the notes on the web, you will have the capacity to actually run the code, directly in your browser, and play around with the values that it gives. The code running will be somewhat limited, and so there may be cases where you are better copying the code onto your own computer, but this provides a really excellent method for getting used to working with R code directly. In this section we will cover some of the very basics of using R, and reading R code. If you are interested, there are plenty of resources to becoming a more proficient R programmer.\n\n1.3.1 Basic Introduction to R Programming\nWhen programming, the basic idea is that we are going to write instructions in a script which we will tell our computer to execute. These instructions are14 performed one-by-one, from the top to the bottom of the script. We can have instructions which operate on their own, or which interact with previous (or future) instructions to add to the complexity. The trick with programming then is to determine which actions you need the computer to perform, in which order, to accomplish the task that you are setting out to do.\nTo begin, we may consider an R program that uses the programming language as a basic calculator.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere, we ask the computer to perform arithmetic operations. We use + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division, and ^ for exponentiation. With the use of parentheses, any expressions relating to these basic operations can be performed. Note that here the result is output after it is computed. Try modifying the exact expressions being computed, allowing you to feel comfortable with these types of mathematical operations.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere, we have two lines of math running with arithmetic operations. Each is output when it is computed. These two results have no ability to interact with one another, and if we were to add more and more lines beneath, the same would continue to happen.\nIf we want different commands to be able to interact with one another, we need a method for storing the results. To do so, we can define variables. In R, to define a variable, we use the syntax variable_name &lt;- variable_value. We can choose almost anything that we want for the variable name15 and the variable value can also be of many types.16 The arrow between the two is the assignment operator and it tells R to assign the variable_value to be accessible from the variable_name.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this code we assign the variable my_5 to contain the value 5, and the variable my_8 to contain the value 8. We can output these as expressions themselves by typing the variable name. Directly outputting these variables is not of particular interest, however, we can use the variables in later statements by including the variable name in them.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere, instead of outputting the variables, we multiply them together. We could have used 5 * 8 in this case for the same result, however, we are afforded a lot more flexibility with this approach. Much of this flexibility comes from our capacity to change the values of variables over time. Consider the following script, and try to understand why the output is the way that it is.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAt the top point in the script, before the first my_5*my_8 call, the variable my_5 has the value 5. However, after this is called, the value is updated to be 10. Then, when we call my_5*my_8 again, this is now simplified to 10 * 8, giving the result. Perhaps more importantly, we can take the value of an expression and assign that to a variable itself.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere, we define another variable. This time, result now contains the result of multiplying our previous two variables. Thus, when we output it, we get the same value. Take a moment to read through the following script, and try to understand what will happen at the end.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe result is 1600. Why? We can read through this step-by-step in order to understand this. First we set our variables to have the values of 5 and 8. Then, result is made to be the product of our two variables, which in this case is 40. After that, we set the value of my_5 to be the same as the value of result, which gives my_5 equal to 40. At this point, result equals 40, my_5 equals 40, and my_8 is equal to 8. The next line updates my_8 to be the same as the value of my_5, which we just clarified was 40. As a result, all of the variables we have defined now take on the value of 40. The final line before output, result &lt;- my_5 * my_8 updates the value of result to be the product of the two variables again, this time giving 40 * 40 which gives 1600.\n\n\n1.3.2 Function Calls in R\nUp until this point we have only used numerical operations and variable assignment. While this allows R to serve as a very powerful calculator, we often want computers to do much more than arithmetic. As a result, we need to explore functions in R. A function is a piece of code which takes in various arguments and outputs some value (or values). Most of the way that we will use R in these notes is through the use of function calls.17 This is exactly analogous to a mathematical function: it is some rule which maps input to output. In fact, some of the most basic functions in R are functions which relate to mathematical functions.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe basic format of a function call will always be function_name(param1, param2, ...). Each of these functions required only a single parameter, however, there are some functions which take more than one parameter. If we have decimal numbers, for instance, we may wish to round them. To do so, we can use the round function in R, which takes two parameters: the number we wish to round, and how many digits we wish to keep.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere are a few things to note about this sequence of function calls. First, notice that we assign the output of a function to a new variable. This behaves exactly as we saw above with numeric calculations. Next, consider that the output of the function18 has a value of \\(3.142\\). That is: we rounded the value to \\(3\\) decimal points, exactly as would be expected. Finally, notice that the second parameter passed to the function call is named. That is, instead of calling round(unrounded_value, 3), we have round(unrounded_value, digits = 3). If you had made the first call this would have worked perfectly.19 However, R also provides the ability to pass in parameter names alongside the parameter values with the syntax function_name(param_name = param_value, ...).\nThe benefit to doing this is two-fold. First, it is easier to read what is happening, especially for function calls that you have never seen before. Second, it removes the need to have the parameters ordered correctly. It is best practice to always include parameter names where you can.\nNow, you may be wondering “how do you know what the parameter names should be?” The names are built-in to the different functions that you are working with, and with experience you will become quite familiar with them. However, at any point you can also run the command ?function_name, replacing function_name with the name of a function you are interested in, to open documentation about that function. There you will see not only the names of the different parameters, but useful information regarding what the function does, and examples of how to call it.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen we run this code, we are given a lot of information. We can see the function name, the details, how it’s called, and so forth. In the Arguments section we get a list of all of the arguments we can pass to the function, along with a description of them. In this case we see that round can take a parameter called x for the number to be rounded, and digits (which we have previously seen).\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis code produces the exact same output, where now both parameters are named. Specifically, we could read this function call as “round the value of x to have digits decimal points.” If you had instead written round(3, unrounded_value), you would get the value 3, since now we are rounding 3 to 3.141592 decimal points.\n\n\n1.3.3 Moving Beyond Numeric Data\nSo far, everything that we have looked at has been numeric data. We have seen integers, and decimals. You can have negative results, say by taking my_var &lt;- -5. And while numbers are frequently useful, we will require further types of data to write useful computer programs. In these notes, we will focus on three additional data types: textual data which (referred to as strings), true and false binary data (referred to as logicals in R), and lists of the same data type (referred to as vectors). They will behave in much the same way as numeric data, with different functions and techniques which can be applied to them.\nTo define a string of text, we encapsulate the text that we are interested in within quotation marks (either single ' or double \" quotation marks will work).\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTwo commonly used functions which rely on strings are paste and print. Each will take in strings as input, and they do not need to be named. The function paste can take in as many strings as you would like. It will “paste” together all the strings provided, creating a longer string out of these. The function print will display the string that is passed as output. Until now we have been running these programs in a way where all calls are displayed as output: this will not always be the case, and so print can come in handy there.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that paste has several additional options which can be investigated in the documentation. This is only the simplest use case for it. In general, strings are particularly helpful when we wish to have output from the computer that will be human readable. Where strings are largely for humans, logicals are largely for computers.\nMuch of what computer programming entails is checking whether certain conditions hold, and then taking different actions depending on what is found. In order to do this, the computer needs a way to represent true and false statements. In R, these are codified with the values TRUE and FALSE. Note, the capital letters here make a difference. You cannot use true or True or any other combination thereof. More important than being able to specify the values TRUE and FALSE directly is the ability to detect whether certain statements are TRUE or FALSE. For this we require comparison operators.\nIf we think of mathematical comparisons we can state whether two things are equal, or not equal, and whether one thing is less than (or equal to) or greater than (or equal to) another. We can run all of these same checks in R.\n\nTo check whether two quantities are equal you use quantity_1 == quantity_2. This statement will be TRUE if quantity_1 and quantity_2 are exactly the same, and will be FALSE otherwise.\nTo check whether two quantities are not equal, you can use quantity_1 != quantity_2. This statement will be TRUE if the quantities differ from one another.\nTo check whether one quantity is larger than another, you can use quantity_1 &gt; quantity_2. If you want to know whether it is greater than or equal to, you can use quantity_1 &gt;= quantity_2.\nTo check whether one quantity is smaller than another, you can use quantity_1 &lt; quantity_2. If you want to know whether it is less than or equal to, you can use quantity_1 &lt;= quantity_2.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere are two key points to note beyond this. First, we will of course not normally compare two constants to one another. We already know that 5==5 and so we would not need to check it. We can, however, plug-in variables, perhaps with unknown values, and have the same types of statements being made. Second, the checks for equality and inequality also work with other data types (like strings).\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe final checks may be slightly odd. Here we are comparing across different types of data. When we do this R will automatically try to convert from one type to the other. With strings and numbers this is not too challenging. If they can be converted nicely between types, then they are and the values are compared. Otherwise, R will conclude they are not equal by default. For logicals, it is important to note that TRUE == 1 and FALSE == 0. We will often use these values interchangeably.\nThe final data type that we will consider are vectors. Vectors store many different values, of the same type, in a single object. Thus, we may have a vector of numeric data, or a vector of strings, or a vector of logicals. The vectors will always contain the same type throughout, but they are stored in a single object (and as such, for instance, can be stored in a single variable). To define a vector we call c(...), where the ... contains the set of objects we want to store in the vector. The c stands for concatenate, as we are concatenating together the set of items into a single container.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe see that each of these vectors holds one type of object. Vectors can be of arbitrary and different lengths. It is also possible to combine multiple vectors of the same type into one, by using the c function again.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere we combine different numeric vectors together. We also show, when forming combined_v3, how numeric vectors can have single items added onto them. That is, if you have a single number, it can be treated as a vector with one element in it. This becomes very useful when building up vectors within code.\nIn addition to combining multiple vectors together, we can also select elements out of a vector. To do this, we use a set of square brackets after the vector’s name, with a number within those square brackets specifying the index of the vector we are interested in. The index is the element position starting at 120 and running to the length of the vector. We can include a vector of indices to select multiple elements at once.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that, each element is selectable individually, giving a single item of that type (in this case, strings). If you select multiple of the elements together, it will create a vector of that type (in this case, a string vector). In addition to selecting elements in this way by their indices, you can also update the elements in the same way.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this example we are changing the last element of the vector. Sometimes we may not know how long the vector actually is, if for instance, it is being built-up as our code runs. If we ever want to check the length of a vector, we can call the function length which takes as input only one vector, and outputs the numeric value of its length.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n1.3.4 Program Control Flow\nWe have seen different types of data, different ways of manipulating data, functions, and variables so far. In order to bring all of these concepts together into useful programs we need some way to control the flow of our programs. We have seen that, by default, programs execute from the top until the bottom. However, it will often be the case that we want want to have certain code running only if certain conditions hold, or that we want to repeat some piece of code many times over. To accomplish these tasks we require control flow statements. We will consider only two types of control flow statements now, which will serve well enough to read most of what needs to be read for these notes.\nThe first type of statement is the conditional statement. Conditional statements execute only when certain conditions hold. The simplest conditional statement is an if statement. The format to define an if statement if if (condition){ ... }, where condition is some logical condition to be evaluated. If the condition is TRUE then the code contained in { … } is evaluated. If the condition is FALSE it is not.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this case, these conditional statement check to see whether the number we entered is larger than zero and whether the number we entered is smaller than zero, respectively. When run, notice that at most one of the statements is executed.21 In this case, we know that only one (or neither) of these statements can be true. When that is the case it may make sense to make use of else clauses in our conditional logic.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere, if the number is greater than 0, then we run the first block of code, otherwise we run the second block of code. Thus, whenever a positive number is entered, we see “My number is a positive”, and whenever a non-positive number is entered, we see “My number is not a positive.” We can extend else blocks to be else if blocks, where further conditions can be specified.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn these case we can pass through each conditional statement in order. First, is the number larger than 50? If so, print the statement, otherwise we check the next condition, is the number greater than 0? Note that if we are checking this condition we know that the number is less than or equal to 50 since it failed the first check. We continue through the rest of this procedure down until the last else block. This block is run only when all of the other conditions fail: that is, our value is not larger than 50, or larger than 0, or smaller than -50, or smaller than 0. The only value that satisfies this is 0 itself.\nSometimes, we wish to check compound conditions. That is, we want to know whether multiple conditions hold, or perhaps, whether at least one of many conditions hold. These statements can be converted into “and” and “or” statements, respectively. To denote “and” statements we use && and to denote “or” statements we use ||. Thus, the check my_val &gt; 0 && my_val &lt; 100 returns true only if my_val is both above 0 and below 100. The check my_val &lt; -50 || my_val &gt; 50 returns true whenever either my_val is less than -50 or my_val is greater than 50.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nConditional statements can grow to be very complex, however, with these rules you can read through them top-to-bottom, substituting for “and” and “or” where necessary. It is also possible, where required, to place one conditional statement inside the code block for another, and to combine them with any of the other techniques that we have learned thus far.\nThe final piece of control flow that we will consider for now is the for loop. The idea with a for loop is that we want to repeat the same action either a certain number of times, or for every item in a set of items. To do so, we use the syntax for(x in vector){...}, where the code in ... will be performed once for every single item in the vector. Within the code block specified by ..., the value x will take on the current value in the loop.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice that three values are printed, in order, 1 then 2 then 3. The loop code is run three different times, one for each element in the list. Each time the loop is running the next value from the list gets assigned to the variable x. The first time it runs it gets the first element, and so forth. As a result, we can use these values in our calculations in whatever way we need to.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhenever we are trying to form a numeric vector with consecutive elements, as we are in c(1,2,3), we can make this easier on ourselves by specifying the upper and lower bounds of the range, separated by a colon. That is c(1,2,3) == 1:3. This is often useful when specify a loop as we very often want to repeat something a set number of times. Note that we do not ever need to use the value of the looping variable. Sometimes, we just want things to repeat, and so the loop is a convenient way to do that.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n1.3.5 Reading Through a More Complex R Program\nTake a moment to read through the following R program and try to understand what is happening exactly. There are comments throughout which will assist in the parsing of the script. We have seen comments up until now, without drawing explicit attention to them. In R, anything placed after a # on the line is considered a comment. The programming language ignores these and so they are only there to help other individuals who may be reading through. It is good practice to comment your code to help others, and also to help yourself whenever you return to it in the future. In these notes code will typically be commented. If you are reading the PDF version of the notes often these comments will be annotations beside the code (numbering certain lines) with the comments provided below, for the sake of legibility.\nNote, this combines everything that we have learned, and it is entirely understandable if it takes some time to process. Fortunately, you can always try running the script yourself, and playing with different components of it. Remember, if you do not know what a function call does, you can use the documentation22 and try playing with it some yourself. To help with the interpretation here, note that this is an implementation of the game that Charles and Sadie have been playing.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n1.3.6 R Programming for Probability Interpretations\nRecall that the motivation for the discussion of R was the Frequentist interpretation of probability. Computers are very effective at repeatedly performing some action. As a result, we can use computers to mimic the idea of repeatedly performing an experiment. Consider the case of flipping a coin over and over again.\nWe can use sample(x, size) as a function to select size realizations from the set contained in x. Thus, if we take sample(x = c(\"H\",\"T\"), size=1) we can view this as flipping a coin one time. If we use the loop structure we talked before, then we can simulate the experience of repeatedly flipping a coin. Consider the following R code. Note, any time that we are doing something which is randomized in R (such as drawing random samples) we also will make use of the set.seed() function. This function takes in an integer value as an argument, and by providing the same integer value we can make sure to always get the same random numbers generated.23 This helps to ensure the repeatability of any R analysis, and it is good practice to do. To see what happens without seeding, try modifying the following code without a seed, and running it several times. Then, set the seed (to any number you like) and do the same process.\nConsider the following code block and this time actually see if you can update the sample sizes, or change the generation process at all. There is no harm in trying: anything you do can be undone be reloading the page!\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt is worth adjusting some of the parameters within the simulation, and seeing what happens. What if you ran the experiment only 5 times? Ten thousand times? What if instead of counting the number of heads, we wanted to count the number of tails? What if we wanted to count the number of times that a six-sided die rolled a 4? All of these settings can be investigated with modifications to the provided script.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nBartoš, František, Alexandra Sarafoglou, Henrik R.

    "text": "2.1 The Sample Space and Events\nIn Chapter 1 we saw the mathematical formulation for the Frequentist interpretation of probability. To study probability, we require a more detailed mathematical model. We want a description, framed in terms of mathematical objects, which will allow us to work out probabilities of interest. In general, to form such a probability model we need both a list of all possible outcomes that the experiment can produce, as well as the probabilities of these outcomes.\nWe call the list of outcomes that can occur from an experiment the sample space of the experiment. The sample space is denoted \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), and is defined as the set of all possible outcomes from the experiment. For instance, if the experiment is flipping a coin we have \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\text{H}, \\text{T}\\}\\). If the experiment is rolling a six-sided die then \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\).\nWith the sample space formally defined, we can revisit Definition 1.2, and formally define the concept of an event.\nTake for instance the experiment of a single coin. In this case, we may define \\(E_1 = \\{\\text{H}\\}\\), \\(E_2 = \\{\\text{T}\\}\\), and \\(E_3 = \\{\\text{H},\\text{T}\\}\\) as examples of possible events. Here, \\(E_1\\) corresponds to the event that a head is observed, \\(E_2\\) corresponds to the event that a tail is observed, and \\(E_3\\) corresponds to the event that either a tails or a heads was observed. Note that for each event we have \\(E_1 \\subset \\mathcal{S}\\), \\(E_2 \\subset \\mathcal{S}\\), and \\(E_3 \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}\\).1\nWhile the events \\(E_1 = \\{\\text{H}\\}\\) and \\(E_2 = \\{\\text{T}\\}\\) each correspond to a simple outcome from the sample space, \\(E_3 = \\{\\text{H},\\text{T}\\}\\) corresponds to a combined event. We call direct outcomes simple events and more complex outcomes like \\(E_3\\) compound events.\nIf we consider rolling a six-sided die, then an example of a simple event is that a four shows up, denoted \\(\\{4\\}\\). A compound event could be that an even number is rolled, \\(\\{2,4,6\\}\\), or that a number greater than or equal to four is rolled, \\(\\{4, 5, 6\\}\\).\nWe say that an event “occurs” if any of the outcomes comprising the event occur. As a result we can have more than one event occurring as the result of a run of a statistical experiment. Suppose that we are rolling a fair, six-sided die. Consider the events “an even number was rolled” and “a number greater than or equal to four was rolled.” If a four or a six are rolled, both of these events happen simultaneously. Our goal when working with probability will be to assign probability values to different events. We will talk about how likely, or unlikely, events of interest are, given the underlying statistical experiment.\nAbove, we defined \\(E_3\\) to be equal to \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). As a result, we can say that \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is an event since \\(\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}\\). This is the event that any outcome is observed, which is certain to happen. Since it is certain to happen, we know it happens with probability \\(1\\). There is another “special” event which is important to consider. We call this the null event. Denoted \\(\\emptyset\\), the null event is an event that corresponds to “nothing in the sample space”. We know that every time an experiment is run something in the sample space occurs, and so the null event is assigned probability zero.",

Indicate why these are events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that an event is any subset of the sample space. In Example 2.1 we define \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) for this game. As a result we can take sets which contain any combinations of these elements. For instance \\(E_1 = \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H})\\}\\), or \\(E_2 = \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{H})\\}\\), or \\[E_3 = \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H}), (\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{H}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{T}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{H}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{H}), (\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{T})\\}.\\] These are all events since \\(E_1 \\subset \\mathcal{S}\\), \\(E_2 \\subset \\mathcal{S}\\), and \\(E_3 \\subset \\mathcal{S}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.3 (Event Identification) Is “Charles has to pay” an event from the game that Charles and Sadie are playing? Why? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n“Charles has to pay” is not directly an event, as it is not a subset of the sample space. This could plausibly be seen as a real-world description of a possible event, but it is not itself an event. The strictness of this language will be relaxed as time goes on, however, it is important to familiarize yourself with how descriptions are converted to events. In this case, we could take an event to be \\[E = \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H}), (\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{H}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{H})\\},\\] and state that if \\(E\\) occurs then Charles has to pay.2\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.4 (Defining Events from Real-World Descriptions) What event corresponds to the description “Sadie has to pay” in the game that Charles and Sadie are playing? Recall that they flip a coin three times, and Charles will pay if at least two heads come up, while Sadie will pay if at least two tails come up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSadie will have to pay whenever there are two or more tails. As a result we can enumerate the possible outcomes that leads to Sadie paying. We have\n\n\\((\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{T})\\);\n\\((\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{T})\\);\n\\((\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{T})\\);\n\\((\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{H})\\).\n\nAny other outcome will have fewer than two tails, and as a result, Sadie will not have to pay. Thus, to form an event, we consider the set with each of these outcomes in it. This gives \\[E = \\{(\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{T}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{T}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{H})\\}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 2.3 (Simple Event) A simple event is any event which corresponds to exactly one outcome from the sample space. A simple event only has one way of occurring. The size of the set for a simple event will be \\(1\\). The sample space, in turn, is made up of a collection of simple events.\n\n\nDefinition 2.4 (Compound Event) A compound event is any event which corresponds to more than one outcome from the sample space. A compound event can occur in multiple different ways. The size of the set for the compound event will be greater than \\(1\\).\n\n\n\nExample 2.5 (Identifying Simple and Compound Events) List an example of (at least) one simple and one compound event from the game that Charles and Sadie are playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a simple event would be \\(E_1 = \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H})\\}\\) since it is comprised of exactly one outcome. If three heads are rolled, this event occurs, there is no other way for it to occur. An example of a compound event would be \\[E_2 = \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{H}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{H}), (\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{T})\\}.\\] Here there are four outcomes that correspond to this event, and if any of those outcomes are observed the event occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 2.5 (Null Event) The null event, denoted \\(\\emptyset\\) or \\(\\{\\}\\), is an event from a statistical experiment which corresponds to nothing within the sample space. The null event has probability zero, and it is impossible to observe. Note that, no matter the sample space, \\(\\emptyset\\subset\\mathcal{S}\\).",

    "section": "2.2 Set Operations for Event Manipulation",
    "text": "2.2 Set Operations for Event Manipulation\nUltimately, all events are sets. These sets are subsets of the sample space, and can contain single or multiple outcomes. Every quantity that we are interested in can be expressed as some set of outcomes of interest. In building up these sets it is common to construct them through the use of “and”, “or”, and “not” statements. That is, we may say that our event occurs if some outcome OR another outcome occurs, or perhaps our outcomes occurs if some outcome does NOT occur.3\nConsider the example of drawing cards from a standard 52-card deck. In such a deck there are 13 card ranks, and four card suits, with one of each combination present. If we draw a single card we can think of the outcomes of the experiment as being any of the 52 possible combinations of rank and suit. We are often interested in an event such as “the card is red”, which is the same as saying “the card is a heart or the card is a diamond.” Perhaps we want to know whether the card was an ace through ten, this is the same as saying “the card is not a Jack or a Queen or a King.” If we are interested in the event that the ace of spades was drawn, this can be expressed by saying that “the card was a spade and the card was an ace.”\nAs you begin to pay attention to the linguistic representation of events that we use, you will notice more and more the use of these words to form compound events in particular. As a result, we give each of them a mathematical operation which allow us to quickly and compactly express these quantities in notation.\n\nExample 2.6 (Description of Events) Describe “Charles has to pay”, based on the game Charles and Sadie are playing, using language revolving around “or”, “and”, and “not” each. That is, describe observing at least two heads, on three flips of a coin, one time using “or”, one time using “and”, and one time using “not”.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many possible ways of doing so. Consider the following:\n\nOR: Two heads are observed OR three heads are observed.\nAND: Not two tails are observed AND not three tails are observed.\nNOT: Not more than one tails are observed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe define mathematical operations to encapsulate the use of or, and, and not. These operations apply to any mathematical sets, whether they refer to events or not.\n\nDefinition 2.6 (Union) The union encodes the use of “or” in reference to two or more sets. Formally, with two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the set of all elements that are contained in \\(A\\), or \\(B\\), or both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). We write \\(A \\cup B\\) and read that as \\(A\\) union \\(B\\). When we wish to take the union of many sets, \\(A_1,A_2,\\dots,A_n\\), we write this as \\[A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_n = \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i.\\]\n\n\nDefinition 2.7 (Intersection) The intersection captures the use of “and” in reference to two or more sets. Formally, the intersection of two sets, \\(A\\), and \\(B\\), is the set that contains all elements that belong to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). We write \\(A \\cap B\\), and say “\\(A\\) intersect \\(B\\).” When we wish to take the intersection of many sets, \\(A_1,A_2,\\dots,A_n\\), we write \\[A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n = \\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i.\\]\n\n\nDefinition 2.8 (Complement) The complement makes formal the concept of “not.” The complement of a set is the set of all elements which occur in the sample space but are not in the given set. We write this as \\(A^C\\) and say “\\(A\\) complement.” When dealing with a sample space, \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), the complement of \\(A\\) is the set of all elements in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) that are not in \\(A\\).\n\n\nExample 2.7 (Basic Set Operations) For the game being played by Charles and Sadie, take \\(E_1 = \\{(\\text{H}, \\text{H}, \\text{H})\\}\\), \\(E_2 = \\{(\\text{H}, \\text{H}, \\text{H}), (\\text{T}, \\text{H}, \\text{H}), (\\text{H}, \\text{T}, \\text{H})\\}\\), and \\(E_3 = \\{(\\text{H}, \\text{H}, \\text{T})\\}\\). Express the following events.\n\n\\(E_1 \\cup E_2\\);\n\\(E_1 \\cap E_2\\);\n\\(E_2^C\\);\n\\(E_2 \\cap E_3\\);\n\\(E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly from definitions we can write down each of the following sets:\n\n\\[E_1 \\cup E_2 =  \\{(\\text{H}, \\text{H}, \\text{H}), (\\text{T}, \\text{H}, \\text{H}), (\\text{H}, \\text{T}, \\text{H})\\} = E_2.\\] As a result, the union of \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) is simply \\(E_2\\).5\n\\[E_1 \\cap E_2 = \\{(\\text{H}, \\text{H}, \\text{H})\\} = E_1.\\] As a result, the intersection of \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) is simply \\(E_1\\).6\n\\[E_2^C =  \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{T}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{H}), (\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{T})\\}.\\]\nFor \\(E_2\\cap E_3\\) note that they share no elements. As a result, the intersection will be empty since there are no elements common to both of them. This gives \\(E_2\\cap E_3 = \\emptyset\\).\n\\[E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3 = \\{(\\text{H}, \\text{H}, \\text{H}), (\\text{T}, \\text{H}, \\text{H}), (\\text{H}, \\text{T}, \\text{H}), (\\text{H}, \\text{H}, \\text{T})\\}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 2.9 (Disjoint Events) Two events, \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are said to be disjoint whenever their intersection is the null event. That is, if \\(E_1 \\cap E_2 = \\emptyset\\) then \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are disjoint events.\n\nThese concepts allow us to more compactly express sets of interest, and in particular, will be quite useful when it comes to assigning probability. The more times you work with the set operations, the more familiar they will become, and as a result, practice is always useful.\nConsider rolling a 6-sided die, and take \\(A\\) to be the event that a \\(6\\) is rolled, \\(B\\) to be the event that the roll was at least \\(5\\), \\(C\\) to be the event that the roll was less than \\(4\\), and \\(D\\) to be the event that the roll was odd.\n\nIf we consider \\(D^C\\) this is the event that the roll was even;\n\\(A \\cup C\\) is the event that a \\(6\\) was rolled or that a number less than \\(4\\) was rolled, which is to say anything other than a \\(4\\) or a \\(5\\), which we may also express as \\(\\{4,5\\}^C\\).\nIf we take \\(A \\cup B\\) then this will be the same as \\(B\\), and \\(A\\cap B\\) will be \\(A\\).\nIf we take the event \\(A\\cap C\\), notice that no outcomes satisfy both conditions, and so \\(A \\cap C = \\emptyset\\).\nWe can also join together multiple operations. \\(D^C \\cap C\\) gives us even numbers than less than \\(4\\), which is to say the outcome \\(2\\).\nSimilarly, \\((A \\cap B)^C\\) would represent the event that a number less than \\(6\\) is rolled.\n\n\nExample 2.8 (Set Operations with Decks of Cards) Charles and Sadie are tiring of flipping their coin, and so they wish to start using decks of cards sometimes instead. Before they formalize a game based on decks of cards, they want to make sure that they are both very comfortable working with these. Suppose that the sample space is defined to be the set of \\(52\\) standard cards that may be drawn on a single draw from the deck. Describe how set operations can be used to form events corresponding to:\n\nA red card is observed.\nAny card between an ace and a ten is observed.\nThe ace of spades is observed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we define several events. Note, these can be defined in shorthand to prevent needing to write out many different cards. we take \\(D\\) to be the event that a diamond is observed, we take \\(H\\) to be the event that a heart is observed, take \\(S\\) to be the event that a spade is observed.7 Take \\(A\\) to be the event that an ace is observed, \\(J\\) to be the event that a Jack is observed, \\(Q\\) to be the event that a Queen is observed, and \\(K\\) to be the event that a King is observed.8 We can use unions, intersections, and complements to express the previously mentioned scenarios.\n\nTo represent outcomes corresponding to “the card is red”, we can use \\(D \\cup H\\).\nTo represent outcomes corresponding to “an ace through ten”, we can use \\((J \\cup Q \\cup K)^C\\).\nTo represent the outcome “the ace of spades”, we may use \\(A \\cap S\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with these basic set operations should eventually become second nature. There are often very many ways of expressing the same event using these different operations, and finding the most useful method of representing a particular event can often be the key to solving challenging probability questions. The first step in making sure that these tools are available to you is in ensuring that the basic operations are fully understood, and this comes via practice. Remember, unions represent “ors”, intersections represent “ands”, and complements represent “nots”.\n\n2.2.1 Using R To Represent Sample Spaces and Events and Performing Set Operations\nWe have seen how R can encode sets of elements using vectors. For instance, we may take sample_space &lt;- 1:6 to represent the sample space of rolling a six-sided die. We can form events by taking subsets of the relevant quantities, selecting via indices. Fortunately, there are also all of the basic set operations implemented in R.\nWe can use union(x, y) to perform the union of x and y, intersect(x, y) to perform the intersection of x and y, and setdiff(x = sample_space, y) to perform the complement of y (assuming that sample_space contains the full sample space).9\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "2.3 Venn Diagrams\nThe sample space is partitioned into outcomes, and the outcomes can be grouped together into events. These events are sets and can be manipulated via basic set operations. Sometimes it is convenient to represent this process graphically through the use of Venn diagrams. In a Venn diagram, the sample space is represented by a rectangle with the possible outcomes placed inside, and events are drawn inside of this as circles containing the relevant outcomes.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: A basic Venn diagram, representing the sample space and two different events. In practice, the sample space would have the possible outcomes written into the rectangle, and the circled events would end up containing the relevant outcomes for those events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Venn diagram then, the overlap between circles represents their intersection, the combined area of two (or more) circles represents their union, and everything outside of a given circle represents the complement. This can be a fairly useful method for representing sample spaces, and for visualizing the basic set operations that we use to manipulate events inside the sample spaces.\nA word of caution: Venn diagrams are useful tools, but they are not suitable as mathematical proofs directly. It is possible to convince yourself of false truths if the wrong diagrams are used, and as a result, Venn diagrams should be thought of as aids to understanding, rather than as a rigorous tool in and of themselves.10\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Union: The union of events A and B is shaded here in red. The union of two sets is all of the contents of both sets, including the overlap between the two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Intersection: The intersection of events A and B is shaded here in red. The intersection of two sets is all of the content shared by both sets, given by the overlapping area of the two circles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Complement: The complement of event A is shaded here in red. The complement of a sets is all of area inside of the sample space, not inside of the set. Here we show the complement of Event A, though Event B would be similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.9 (Venn Diagram with Defined Events) Draw a Venn diagram representing the original game that Charles and Sadie played. On the diagram draw the events corresponding to “At least one head and one tail are observed”, and “Sadie won the game”. Recall that three coins are tossed, and Sadie wins if at least two of them show heads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sample space contains the eight possible options. Only \\((\\text{T}, \\text{T}, \\text{T})\\) does not belong to at least one of the events. Both events share \\((\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{T})\\), \\((\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{H})\\), and \\((\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{H})\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nSample spaces, events, and the manipulation of these quantities forms a critical component of understanding probability models. In particular, they describe the complete set of occurrences in a statistical experiment that we could be interested in assigning probability values to. To formalize a probability model, however, we also need some rule for assigning probability values.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 Assigning Probabilities (and The Equally Likely Outcome Model)\nThere are a plethora of ways to assign probabilities to different events. At the most basic level any rule that maps from the space of possible events to real numbers between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) can be used as rules for probability assignment. That is, probability assignment is a set of rules which says “for this event assign this probability.”\nNot every assignment of probability values is going to be valid. Suppose, for instance, that we have a six-sided die, each side labelled with a number from one to six. If I told you that there was a probability of \\(0.5\\) that it comes up \\(1\\), \\(0.5\\) that it comes up \\(2\\), \\(0.5\\) that it comes up \\(3\\), \\(0.5\\) that it comes up \\(4\\), \\(0.5\\) that it comes up \\(5\\), and \\(0.5\\) that it comes up \\(6\\), you would probably call me a liar.1 If, as we have previously seen, probabilities represent the long run proportion of time that a particular event is observed, we cannot have \\(6\\) different outcomes each occurring in half of all cases.\nBeyond the restrictions that we impose to form “valid” probability rules, we have another concern: scalability. It is perfectly acceptable to indicate that in an experiment with \\(3\\) outcomes, the first has a probability of \\(0.25\\), the second of \\(0.3\\), and the third of \\(0.45\\). What if the experiment has \\(100\\) possible outcomes? Or \\(1000\\)? It quickly becomes apparent that enumerating the probabilities of each event in the sample space is not an efficient way of assigning probabilities in practice. A core focus of our study of probability will be finding techniques that allow us to efficiently encode probability information into manageable objects. Once we have done this we will be in a position where we can manipulate these (comparatively) simple mathematical quantities in order to make statements and conclusions about any of the events of interest, even if they have never been explicitly outlined as having an assigned probability.\nWhile we will consider myriad methods for accomplishing these goals throughout our study of probability, we begin with a very useful model which simplifies probability assignment, without any added complexity, and creates a solid foundation for us to explore the properties of probability models. We start by considering equally likely outcomes. As the name suggests, the probability model considering equally likely outcomes assigns an equal probability to every possible outcome of the experiment. This is a probability model that we are already distinctly familiar with: flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a card are all examples of experiments which rely on the equally likely outcomes framework.\nIf we have an experiment with a sample space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) which has \\(|\\mathcal{S}| = k\\) total elements4, then each element of the sample space occurs with probability \\(\\dfrac{1}{k}\\). In the case of the coin toss example, \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\text{H}, \\text{T}\\}\\), and so \\(k=2\\) and each outcome occurs with probability \\(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\). In the case of drawing a card at random, there are \\(52\\) different outcomes, and so \\(k=52\\), and the probability of drawing any particular card is \\(\\dfrac{1}{52}\\).\nIt is critically important to recognize that the equal probability model assigns equal likelihood to the possible outcomes of an experiment, not the possible events of interest. It will not be the case that all events have the same probability. To make this concrete, consider the events \\(A\\) “the ace of spades is drawn” and \\(B\\) “any spade is drawn”. It is clear that \\(B\\) happens more frequently than \\(A\\), even though we have said that this is an experiment with equally likely outcomes. Remember: an outcome is an observation from a single experimental run, an event is any collection of these possible outcomes.\nA core goal is then bridging the gap between the probability of an outcome5 and the probability of an event. In order to do so, we will next consider the rules of probability, introducing properties that are required for valid probability assignments, and the techniques for manipulating probabilities to calculate the probabilities of quantities of interest.",

    "text": "Example 3.1 (Coin Toss Probabilities) Suppose that the fair coin used by Charles and Sadie is tossed one time. Write down the probability assignments relating to this experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case we have \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\text{H},\\text{T}\\}\\). Thus, the possible events for which we need to assign probabilities are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{\\text{H}\\}\\), \\(\\{\\text{T}\\}\\), and \\(\\{\\text{H},\\text{T}\\} = \\mathcal{S}\\).

In statistics and probability courses and books you will often have instructors or authors using fairly simple models to illustrate probability concepts. There will often be questions relating to coin tosses, and dice, and decks of cards, and everyone’s favourite: urns. It will very frequently be the case that a statistics question will state that there is an urn with some combination of coloured balls within it, from which you will be selecting some number either with or without replacement. The frequency of these types of examples and questions often feels disconnected from the refrain that “uncertainty is all around us” and that “statistics is relevant to every aspect of our world!”2 Why is it that we seldom see questions or examples that are directly tied to these wide spread applications of the lessons and techniques being taught?\nIn part these simple experiments are cleaner to handle than “real world” situations. We can easily assume that a die is fair and that takes care of any unsuspecting wrinkles that will necessarily come along with the “real world”. This is not dissimilar to working under the assumption of frictionless surfaces in introductory physics, or assuming that human beings are rational in economics. Another key point is that most of us have deep familiarity with dice, and coins, and cards.3 The same is not going to be true of stories that are derived from different use cases in the real world. A final important point, and this will be something we see in depth in the coming chapters, is that from a statistical point of view: there is no difference. Once we have the tools to work with these quantities, we have the tools to work with any of the quantities. This actually distinguishes the use of these types of examples in statistics and probability from those for other subjects: at no point is anything that we are learning incorrect, or overly simple - we are just focusing on the raw probabilistic nature of the phenomenon. As a result, we will continue to see these simple models in these notes. I would encourage you, whenever possible, to hold a topic in mind that matters more to you and start trying to draw the parallels between rolling dice, and whatever it is that you may care about.\nWhy urns, specifically? Well, whether it be coin flipping or dice rolling or card selection, we can model this equivalently using an urn (with \\(2\\), \\(6\\), and \\(52\\) items, respectively). The urn becomes more flexible to exactly dictate what the probability of any selection will be, which is a useful way of moving from equally likely models (each ball is equally likely to be selected) to arbitrary models (we can have however many identical balls in the urn as we would like).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Using R for the Equally Likely Probability Model\nIn the previous chapter we saw how we can codify sample spaces and events using vectors in R. In the introduction we actually saw how can sample from a sample space using the equally likely outcome framework. Specifically, an application of the sample function will draw a set number of values from a sample space, giving each value an equal probability to be drawn.6\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "section": "3.2 The Axioms of Probability",
    "text": "3.2 The Axioms of Probability\nWe have previously seen that not every probability assignment can be valid. For instance, assigning \\(0.5\\) probability to each outcome on a die leads to a nonsensical scenario. With just a little imagination, we can conjure equally nonsensical scenarios in other ways. For instance, it would make very little sense to discuss the probability of an event being a negative value. What would it mean for an event to occur in a negative proportion of experimental runs? Alternatively, we can consider two events that are nested in one another: say event \\(A\\) is that we draw the ace of spades, and event \\(B\\) is that we draw any spade. Every single time that \\(A\\) happens, we know that \\(B\\) also happens. But there are ways that \\(B\\) can occur where \\(A\\) does not.7 If I told you the probability of \\(A\\) was \\(0.5\\) and the probability of \\(B\\) was \\(0.2\\), this would violate our base instincts. How can it be more likely to draw the ace of spades than it would be to draw any spade at all?8\nOften in mathematics when we have an intuitive set of rules9 that particular quantities must obey, we work to add formality through defining properties of these concepts. To this end, we can define the key properties that probabilities must obey in order to be well-defined, valid probabilities. With three fairly basic properties, we can completely specify what must be true in order for a set of probabilities to be “valid”, and to in turn align with our intuitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Axioms of Probability\n\n\n\n\nUnitary: Every valid set of probabilities must assign a probability of \\(1\\) to the full sample space. That is, \\(P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1\\). This is an intuitive requirement as every time the experiment is run we observe an outcome in the sample space. As a result, in every experimental run the event \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) occurs.\nNon-negative: We require that every probability is non-negative. We can have probabilities of \\(0\\), but we can never have a probability less than zero. Again, this is sensible10 but is important to include in our formalization. Specifically, for every event \\(E\\), we must have \\(P(E) \\geq 0\\).\nAdditivity: the final property requires slightly more parsing on first pass. Suppose that we define a sequence of events, \\(E_1, E_2, E_3, \\dots\\) such that no two events have any overlap. That is, \\(E_j \\cap E_\\ell = \\emptyset\\) for all \\(\\ell\\neq j\\). Then, the final property we require for probabilities is that \\[P(E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3 \\cup \\cdots) = P\\left(\\bigcup_i E_i\\right) = \\sum_i P(E_i) = P(E_1) + P(E_2) + P(E_3) + \\cdots.\\] That is, the probability of the union of disjoint events is the summation of the probability of these events.\n\n\n\nIt is worth dwelling slightly on axiom 3. Consider the case of drawing a card at random from a deck of \\(52\\) cards. Using the equally likely outcome model for probability we know that the probability that any card is drawn is given by \\(\\dfrac{1}{52}\\). If I were to ask “what is the probability you draw that ace of spades?” under this model you can respond, immediately, with \\(\\dfrac{1}{52}\\). Now, if I were to ask “what is the probability that you draw the ace of spades or the two of spades?” then intuitively you likely figure that this will be \\(\\dfrac{2}{52}\\). Note that the event \\(E_1\\), “draw the ace of spades” and the event \\(E_2\\) “draw the two of spades”, are disjoint events. Moreover, recall that the union is the “or” and so \\(E_1\\cup E_2\\) is the same as \\(E_1\\) or \\(E_2\\). Taken together then, \\[P(E_1\\cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2).\\] The axiom of additivity extends this intuition to an arbitrary number of events.\n\nExample 3.2 (Basic Additivity) Still unsure of how best to go about using cards to replace their coin game, Charles and Sadie are considering various different events and trying to understand their probabilistic behaviour. They take \\(S\\), \\(C\\), \\(H\\), and \\(D\\) to be the events that a spade, club, heart, or diamond are drawn from a standard deck of cards, respectively. Further, they take \\(C_j\\) to be the event that a card with denomination \\(j\\) is drawn (\\(j\\) ranging from ace with \\(1\\) through King with \\(13\\)). If they consider the union of any two (or more) of these events when can they leverage properties of additivity? When can’t they?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use the properties of additivity it is required that the two events are disjoint. Note that taking any two (or more) of \\(S\\), \\(C\\), \\(H\\), and \\(D\\) will lead to disjoint events. There is no way to draw a card which has two suits on it at once. Similarly, taking any two (or more) of \\(C_j\\) will lead to disjoint events. However, mixing any of the suited events (\\(S\\), \\(C\\), \\(H\\), and \\(D\\)) with any \\(C_j\\) will not be disjoint.\nConsider \\(S\\cap C_1\\). The ace of spades is in \\(S\\) since it is a spade and it is in \\(C_1\\) since it is an ace. As a result, \\(S\\cap C_1 = \\{\\text{Ace of Spades}\\}\\). Because of this we are not able to say that \\(P(A \\cup C_1) = P(A) + P(C_1)\\). However, we can say that \\[P(S\\cup C\\cup H\\cup D) = P(S) + P(C) + P(H) + P(D),\\] and could do the same with any subset of these sets. Similarly, we can take \\[P\\left(\\bigcup_{j=1}^{13} C_j\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{13} P(C_j),\\] or any of the subsets there.\n\n\n\n\nThese three axioms fully define valid probabilities. Any mechanism that assigns probability values to events which conform to these rules will assign valid probabilities. While it may seem counterintuitive that such basic rules fully define our notion of a probability, these rules readily give rise to many other properties that are very useful when working with probabilities.",

    "text": "3.3 Secondary Properties of Probabilities\nUsing the previously indicated axioms of probability we are able to derive many useful secondary properties. These properties will frequently be used to actually compute different probabilities, and are helpful to become familiar with. All of the following properties follow directly from the axioms, though, some are more clear than others. For the following we take \\(E\\) and \\(E_1,E_2,E_3,\\dots\\) to be arbitrary events on some well defined sample space.\n\nComplements: \\(P(E^C) = 1-P(E)\\), and equivalently, \\(P(E) = 1 - P(E^C)\\).\nNull Event: \\(P(\\emptyset) = 0\\).\nArbitrary Unions (Two Events): \\(P(E_1 \\cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2) - P(E_1\\cap E_2)\\).\nArbitrary Unions (Three Events): \\[\\begin{multline*}P(E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3) = P(E_1) + P(E_2) + P(E_3) - P(E_1\\cap E_2) - P(E_1 \\cap E_3) \\\\ - P(E_2 \\cap E_3) + P(E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3).\\end{multline*}\\]\nContainment: If \\(E_1 \\subset E_2\\) then \\(P(E_1) \\leq P(E_2)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProofs of the Secondary Properties of Probability\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be instructive to see how these properties are derived. Doing so generates added familiarity with manipulating probability expressions and helps to encourage deeper understanding.\n\nNote that, for any event \\(E\\), by definition we have \\(E \\cup E^C = \\mathcal{S}\\) and \\(E \\cap E^C = \\emptyset\\). As a result, we can apply additivity to the sets \\(E\\) and \\(E^C\\) giving \\(P(E \\cup E^C) = P(E) + P(E^C)\\). However, since \\(E\\cup E^C = \\mathcal{S}\\), then we know that \\(P(E \\cup E^C) = P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1\\) by the unitary property. Taken together this tells us that \\(1 = P(E) + P(E^C)\\), and rearranging gives \\(P(E^C) = 1 - P(E)\\), or \\(P(E) = 1 - P(E^C)\\), as required.\nWe know that \\(\\mathcal{S}^C = \\emptyset\\). Using secondary property (1), \\(P(E) = 1 - P(E^C)\\). Taking \\(E = \\emptyset\\) gives \\(P(\\emptyset) = 1 - P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1 - 1 = 0\\), by the unitary property.\nHere note that \\(E_1 \\cup E_2\\) can be written as \\(E_1 \\cup E_2'\\) where \\(E_2' = E_2\\cap E_1^C\\). That is, \\(E_2'\\) contains the outcomes from \\(E_2\\) which were not shared by \\(E_1\\). Then \\(E_1 \\cap E_2' = \\emptyset\\) so we can write \\(P(E_1 \\cup E_2) = P(E_1 \\cup E_2') = P(E_1) + P(E_2')\\), by additivity. Now, if we define \\(E_2^* = E_2\\cap E_1\\) then \\(E_2 = E_2' \\cup E_2^*\\), and \\(E_2'\\cap E_2^* = \\emptyset\\). Thus, \\(P(E_2) = P(E_2'\\cup E_2^*) = P(E_2') + P(E_2^*)\\). Rearranging this gives \\(P(E_2') = P(E_2) - P(E_2^*)\\), and we know that \\(P(E_2^*) = P(E_1 \\cap E_2)\\). Thus, plugging into what we found before we get \\[P(E_1 \\cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2') = P(E_1) + P(E_2) - P(E_1 \\cap E_2).\\]\nThis follows exactly from the argument for (3). To see, first consider \\(E_2 \\cup E_3\\) to be an event itself, say \\(E_4\\). Then we can apply the above result to \\(E_1 \\cup E_4\\). And then we need only repeat the process for the remaining terms.\nWe can rewrite \\(E_2\\) as \\(E_1 \\cup (E_2 \\cap E_1^C)\\). These two sets are disjoint, since the one is \\(E_1\\) and the other must contain only elements in \\(E_1^C\\). Then, \\(P(E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2 \\cap E_1^C)\\) by additivity. Then, through the non-negative property we know that \\(P(E_2 \\cap E_1^C) \\geq 0\\), and so rearranging we have \\(P(E_1) = P(E_2) - P(E_2\\cap E_1^C) \\leq P(E_2)\\).\n\n\n\n\nThese properties are useful when computing probabilities. In fact, these secondary properties will be used with more frequency than the basic axioms when manipulating probabilities in practice. It is worth building comfort with these properties, early and often, as they will assist in manipulating all probability expressions in the future.\nWhile these properties hold in general for all probability models, it is instructive to focus on the equal probability model to begin building familiarity with probability. These properties allow us to take events – whether compound or simple – and combine, rewrite, and manipulate expressions to assist in the handling of the computations. Consider a simple event, \\(A\\).\nRecall that a simple event is defined as single outcome of an experiment, and so in this case, \\(A\\) corresponds directly to an event that may be observed. If our sample space is \\(k\\) elements large, then \\(P(A) = \\dfrac{1}{k}\\) in this framework. For instance, if \\(A\\) is the event that a two is rolled on a six-sided fair die, then \\(P(A) = \\dfrac{1}{6}\\).\nNow, suppose that a compound event is defined, \\(B\\). By definition, a compound event can be expressed as a set of possible outcomes from the experiment. Suppose that we enumerate these possible events as \\(b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_\\ell\\). Then we know that \\(B\\) occurs if any of \\(b_1,b_2,\\dots,b_\\ell\\) occur. Each \\(b_j\\) are elements of the sample space and correspond to possible outcomes of the experiment. As a result, we know that \\(P(b_j) = \\dfrac{1}{k}\\), based on the equal probability assumption. Now, if we take any two distinct events, say \\(b_i\\) and \\(b_j\\), we know that they must be disjoint: \\(b_i \\cap b_j = \\emptyset\\). This is because in an experiment run only one outcome can occur. Moreover, we can say that \\(B = b_1 \\cup b_2 \\cup\\cdots\\cup b_\\ell\\).Using the axioms of probability outlined above we therefore know that \\(P(B) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\ell P(b_j) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\ell \\dfrac{1}{k} = \\dfrac{\\ell}{k}\\). This holds in general for any compound event in this setting.\nIf we take \\(B\\) to be the event that an even number is rolled on a six-sided die, then we would have \\(b_1\\) is the event that a two is rolled, \\(b_2\\) is the event that a four is rolled, and \\(b_3\\) is the event that a six is rolled. There are three such events, and so the probability that an even number is rolled must be \\(\\dfrac{3}{6} = 0.5\\), which matches our intuition.\nAt its core, this process is counting up the number of ways that \\(B\\) can occur, and dividing by the total number of elements in the set. There were \\(\\ell\\) ways of \\(B\\) occurring, and a total of \\(k\\) outcomes in the experiment, so the probability becomes \\(\\dfrac{\\ell}{k}\\). In the equal probability model, this will always be the case. The probability of any event \\(A\\) occurring is given by \\[P(A) = \\dfrac{N_A}{k},\\] where \\(N_A\\) is the number of unique ways that \\(A\\) can occur. In other words, \\(N_A\\) is the size of the set \\(A\\), \\(|A|\\).\nAs a result of this, computing probabilities largely relies on the counting of possible outcomes corresponding to different events. If we can determine \\(N_A = |A|\\), and the count of the total number of occurrences, \\(k\\), then we can determine the probability of \\(A\\). This study of counting is known as combinatorics, and it is where we will turn our attention next.\n\nExample 3.3 (Unmatched Six-Sided Dice) Charles and Sadie, not all together content with the progress through decks of cards, are considering games with dice. Suppose that they have two, fair, six-sided dice. They are interested in the probability that the two dice show different numbers when they are rolled. What is this probability?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can solve this problem directly by counting up the number of ways that the two dice can show different numbers, and divide that by the total number of combinations. Consider the following enumeration of the possible realizations:\n\n\n\n1, 1\n1, 2\n1, 3\n1, 4\n1, 5\n1, 6\n\n\n\n\n2, 1\n2, 2\n2, 3\n2, 4\n2, 5\n2, 6\n\n\n\n\n3, 1\n3, 2\n3, 3\n3, 4\n3, 5\n3, 6\n\n\n\n\n4, 1\n4, 2\n4, 3\n4, 4\n4, 5\n4, 6\n\n\n\n\n5, 1\n5, 2\n5, 3\n5, 4\n5, 5\n5, 6\n\n\n\n\n6, 1\n6, 2\n6, 3\n6, 4\n6, 5\n6, 6\n\n\n\nThere are \\(36\\) possible outcomes. In each column, \\(5\\) of the options show different numbers, so that leads to a total of \\(30\\) outcomes showing different numbers, leading to a probability of \\(\\dfrac{30}{36} = \\dfrac{5}{6}\\).\nHere, a faster way to approach the problem is to realize that the probability is easier to solve when considering the complement rather than the event itself. Notably, rolling two, fair, six-sided dice gives a total of \\(36\\) possible outcomes. Of these, exactly \\(6\\) have equal numbers showing on both dice. Thus, the probability that the two dice show the same number is going to be \\(\\dfrac{6}{36} = \\dfrac{1}{6}\\). Then, using the fact that \\(P(E) = 1 - P(E^C)\\), and that taking \\(E\\) to refer to the event where the two dice show different numbers, then \\(E^C\\) refers to the event that the two dice show the same number. As a result, the probability that we want is \\(P(E) = 1 - \\dfrac{1}{6} = \\dfrac{5}{6}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.4 (Unmatched Arbitrary Dice) Charles and Sadie, working from their intrigue about dice, have decided that instead of using two six-sided dice, they wish to take two dice of possibly different sizes. Suppose that the first die has \\(d_1\\) sides and the second has \\(d_2\\) sides, and that both dice are otherwise fair. They are interested in the probability that the two dice show different numbers when they are rolled. What is this probability?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis problem is conceptually no different from Example 3.3. There will be a total of \\(d_1\\times d_2\\) possible combinations of the two dice to be rolled.11 Of these, the dice will match in \\(\\min\\{d_1, d_2\\}\\) events.12 Then, with the same complement trick, we get \\[P(E) = 1 - P(E^C) = 1 - \\frac{\\min\\{d_1,d_2\\}}{d_1\\times d_2}.\\]",

    "text": "3.4 Combinatorics\n\n3.4.1 The Product Rule\nFundamentally, counting is a matter of assessing the size of a collection of items. Sometimes, this is very straightforward. If you want to count the number of students in a classroom, you start at \\(1\\) and enumerate upwards through the integers. To count the number of days until the next Holiday, you do the same thing. If you really need to sleep, perhaps you will count imaginary sleep until you drift off. There is not much to this type of counting, and it is certainly deeply familiar to you all. However, it is also quite limited in its utility.\nImagine that you are interested in determining how many possible ways there are of arranging a deck of \\(52\\) cards. You could of course arrange them in a particular order, then count each of those. That would take a tremendous amount of time, so perhaps instead of using an actual deck you just write down the combinations. Still, each combination is going to be \\(52\\) cards long, and keeping track of that all will be a challenge. This seems like an approachable question, and yet, it illustrates how complicated (and large) these types of “counting” problems can become very quickly.\nFortunately for us there are some strategies for simplifying these problems down, some of which you are likely already familiar with. Think about trying to form an outfit where you have \\(4\\) different sweaters, \\(3\\) pairs of pants, and \\(2\\) options for your shoes. Suppose that any combination of these will work well. How many total outfits are there? Well, if you have already picked your sweater and pants, then there are going to be \\(2\\) different outfits using these: one with each of the pairs of shoes. This is true for each possible sweater-pant combination, and so we can count \\(2\\) for each one these. In other words, to get the total number of outfits we multiply the number of sweater-pant combinations by the number of shoe options. The same rationale can be applied to count the total number of sweater-pant combinations. For each sweater, there are \\(3\\) pairs of possible pants, and so to get the total number we can take \\(3\\) for each possible sweater, or in other words, \\(3\\times 4\\). Taken together then we have \\(4\\times 3\\times 2 = 24\\) total possible outfits.\nAnother way of framing this is that we have to make three sequential decisions: which of the \\(4\\) sweaters, which of the \\(3\\) pants, and which of the \\(2\\) shoes are to be worn? When we do this we multiply through the number of alternatives at each decision point to get the total number of combinations. This is known as the product rule for counting.\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Product Rule for Counting) The product rule for counting states that, when there are a sequence of \\(k\\) decisions to be made, and for each decision \\(j=1,\\dots,k\\), there are \\(n_j\\) options, then the total number of combinations will be \\[N = n_1\\times n_2\\times\\cdots\\times n_k.\\]\n\n\nExample 3.5 (Counting Coffee Orders) When Charles and Sadie are out for coffee, Sadie enjoys ordering the same thing each time: a black coffee and vegan chocolate chip cookie. Charles, on the other hand, has decided to work through the entire menu of the local coffee shop, each day ordering a drink, with one add-in, and a snack. If there are \\(10\\) different drinks, \\(8\\) possible add-ins, and \\(12\\) different snacks, how many trips to the coffee shop will it take until Charles has tried it all?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis necessitates an application of the product rule for counting. Specifically, we can view this as three sequential decisions, where the first decision is which drink (with \\(n_1 = 10\\)), the second decision is which add-in (with \\(n_2 = 8\\)), and the third decision is which snack (with \\(n_3 = 12\\)). Taking the product gives the total number of combinations as \\(10\\times 8\\times 12 = 960\\). As a result, it will take \\(960\\) visits (assuming that nothing on the menu changes!) to try all combinations.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.6 (Sequence of Dice Rolls) Charles and Sadie have been enjoying playing with dice, but they lost one of the two they had. As a result, they are trying to come up with games revolving around rolling a single die. They decide to try a game called “six is lava”, where they roll a single six-sided die \\(10\\) times in a row. If they get \\(1\\) or more sixes, they lose the game. They are not sure if \\(10\\) is the correct number of rolls to use. What is the probability that they lose on any given set of \\(10\\) rolls of the die in this game?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again this is a scenario where using the complement simplifies the problem. If we asked “what is the probability that no 6’s are rolled, on \\(10\\) rolls of the die” then we can count the number of possibilities through an application of the product rule. In particular, there are going to be \\(5\\) options which are not \\(6\\) at each possible step. We can view this as have \\(n_1 = n_2 = \\cdots = n_{10} = 5\\). Thus, the total number of ways of rolling no sixes is \\(5\\times5\\times5\\times\\cdots\\times5 = 5^{10}\\).\nEssentially the same process can be used to count the total number of possible rolls, replacing \\(5\\) with \\(6\\) to get the denominator. This means that there are \\(6^{10}\\) total sequences of \\(10\\) rolls, and \\(5^{10}\\) which contain no sixes. As a result, taking \\(E\\) to represent the probability that we observe no sixes on \\(10\\) rolls of the die, we would get \\[P(E) = \\frac{5^{10}}{6^{10}}.\\] The question asks for \\(E^C\\) and so we take \\[P(E^C) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{10}.\\] This is approximately 0.8385.\nNote that if instead of \\(10\\) flips they had \\(n\\) flips, the probability would be \\(1 - \\left(5/6\\right)^n\\). We can plot this over various values of \\(n\\), to see how the number of flips impacts this probability. The probability of \\(0.5\\) is marked and we can see that taking \\(4\\) tosses gives an ever so slightly greater than \\(0.5\\) probability of losing (0.5177).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Tree Diagrams\nSometimes it is helpful to express counting rules graphically. To do so we rely on tree diagrams.\n\nDefinition 3.2 (Tree Diagram) A tree diagram is a graphical representation for the product rule for counting. Specifically, a tree diagram puts each of the decisions in sequence, and draws a branch for each separate option, starting from the branches drawn at the previous decision step.\n\nTo draw a tree diagram, you start with the first choice, drawing one branch for each of the \\(n_1\\) alternatives, labelling each. Then, at the second choice, you do the same process at the end of each of the branches you drew for choice \\(1\\), this time drawing \\(n_2\\) branches there (so you will have just drawn \\(n_1\\times n_2\\) branches). Then for each of those you draw the \\(n_3\\) further branches, and so on and so forth until the end.\nIf you want to know the total number of choices, you count the end points at the very end of the diagram. Each branch corresponds to a single option. To determine which combination of choices it corresponds to, you read off the branch labels at each branch you take. If you want to know how many possible combinations come with certain options selected, you can look at only those branches which are downstream from the choices that you care about.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: A generic tree diagram. Here the first choice has three different options and the second choice has two. We can see the six total combinations, labelled on the right of the diagram, and can trace the choices required to get there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile tree diagrams can be quite useful for visualizing a problem, they often grow to be overly complex. As a result, we need to fall back on the numerical representation afforded to us through the product rule for counting. Counting problems, in general, can very quickly become large and complex. For this reason, we have several tools to assist us in reducing this complexity based on common types of problems that we would like to count.\n\n\n3.4.3 The Factorial\nThe first useful tool for simplifying these problems is the factorial. The factorial of an integer, denoted by \\(x!\\) is given by the product of all integers from \\(x\\) to \\(1\\).13 That is, \\[x! = x(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(2)(1).\\] If we consider the product rule for counting then note that if \\(n_1=1\\), \\(n_2=2\\), … , \\(n_k = k\\), then the total number of options is \\(k\\times(k-1)\\times\\cdots\\times 1 = k!\\). The most common reason that this comes up is when we want to order a collection of items.\nSuppose that you have \\(10\\) books that you want to place on a shelf. You can view this as making \\(10\\) sequential decisions: what book goes first, second, third, and so on. There are \\(10\\) options for the first book, then \\(9\\) for the second (any except for the first one), \\(8\\) for the third (any except for the first \\(2\\)). This continues down to the last book, and so we conclude that there are \\(10\\times9\\times8\\times\\cdots\\times1 = 10!\\) ways of arranging these books.\n\nExample 3.7 (Seating in a (Full) Coffee Shop) One day Charles and Sadie walk into the coffee shop and find that it is completely full. There are ten seats and ten people sitting in them. They are disappointed that they do not have room to sit themselves, however, they are never ones to pass up an interesting probability question.\n\nHow many different ways could these ten people have sat in these ten seats?\nIf there are ten drinks that have been made, and one is to be passed out to each seat, how many different ways can these ten people sit in these ten seats, with each of these ten drinks?\nAlongside the ten drinks, there are ten snacks to be served up as well. How many different ways can these ten people sit in these ten seats, with each of these ten drinks, and each of these ten snacks?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can think about lining up the ten seats in a row, each number \\(1\\) through \\(10\\). Then, we want to place one patron into each of the seats. This is no different from ordering \\(10\\) books, and so the total is \\(10!\\) which is \\(3,628,800\\).\nNote that we still have to make the seat choices from part (a), so there are \\(10!\\) ways of getting the \\(10\\) people sat in the \\(10\\) chairs. Once there, we can think of handing out the drinks to each of the numbered combinations of person-chair. This is no different from passing out the people as well, giving \\(10!\\) ways of doing this. We use the product rule to combine these two choices, with \\(10!\\times 10!\\) total combinations of people-chair-drink. This is \\(13,168,189,440,000\\).\nExtending the same logic before, there are \\(10!\\times 10!\\) ways of getting each person sat in a chair with a drink. Then, there will be an additional \\(10!\\) ways of passing out the snacks to these people. Taken together this gives \\(10!\\times 10!\\times 10!\\) which is \\(47,784,725,839,872,000,000\\).14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (0!). Depending on how factorials are thought of, some trouble can come up around a quantity like \\(0!\\). On one hand, if we view factorials as multiplying each number between \\(n\\) and \\(1\\) together then \\(0! = 0\\times 1\\) and we get \\(0! = 0\\). On the other hand, if we view factorials as counting the number of ways which we can order a set of \\(n\\) items, then \\(0!\\) is the number of ways we can order \\(0\\) items, which is \\(1\\).15 So, which is it?\nWe take \\(0!\\) to be equal to \\(1\\). The ordering argument is perhaps the most convincing. However, if you are algebraically minded you may wonder how we get around the tricky issue of using our algebraic definition. The key insight is to not define \\(n!\\) as the product of the numbers from \\(n\\) to \\(1\\), but rather, to define \\[(n-1)! = \\frac{n!}{n},\\] and specify that \\(1! = 1\\). Then in this case we get all of the usual requirements for how we have discussed factorials, but we also get that \\(0! = \\dfrac{(0+1)!}{(0+1)} = 1\\). As a result, we will take \\(0! = 1\\).16\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Permutations and Combinations\nSometimes, we want to order items from a collection, but we want to only take a subset of these items. That is, suppose that you have \\(20\\) books, only \\(9\\) of them will fit on the shelf, and you want to know “how many ways can you put \\(9\\) books on the shelf, in order, from your collection of \\(20\\)?” Using the product rule of counting for this directly, we recognize that there are \\(20\\) options for the first, then \\(19\\), then \\(18\\), and so on until there are \\(12\\) choices for the \\(9\\)th book to place. We can write this out in a seemingly strange way. \\[\\begin{align*}\n  &\\ (20)(19)(18)(17)(16)(15)(14)(13)(12) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{(20)(19)(18)(17)(16)(15)(14)(13)(12)(11)(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)}{(11)(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{(20)(19)(18)(17)(16)(15)(14)(13)(12)\\cancel{(11)}\\cancel{(10)}\\cancel{(9)}\\cancel{(8)}\\cancel{(7)}\\cancel{(6)}\\cancel{(5)}\\cancel{(4)}\\cancel{(3)}\\cancel{(2)}\\cancel{(1)}}{\\cancel{(11)}\\cancel{(10)}\\cancel{(9)}\\cancel{(8)}\\cancel{(7)}\\cancel{(6)}\\cancel{(5)}\\cancel{(4)}\\cancel{(3)}\\cancel{(2)}\\cancel{(1)}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis expression is \\(20!\\) divided by \\(11!\\), and gives the same as our argument from the product rule for counting directly. This is a more general result than our example with books would suggest. If we have \\(n\\) items, and we want to choose \\(k\\) of them taking into account the order those choices, it will always be \\(n!\\) divided by \\((n-k)!\\). We call this a permutation.\n\nDefinition 3.3 (Permutations) If we wish to select \\(k\\) items from a collection of \\(n\\) items, where the ordering of these selections matters, then the total number is referred to as a permutation. Mathematically, \\[P_{n,k} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.\\]\n\nPermutations arise when we select ordered subsets from a collection. We often, in combinatorial problems, talk about ordering, though sometimes what we mean by this is slightly more abstract. Suppose that you want to form a committee with \\(5\\) different people, each of which occupies a different role: the president, vice president, treasurer, note taker, and critic. If there are \\(30\\) people to select for this then there are \\(P_{30,5}\\) total possible committees that can be formed. While there is not a sequential order here, we talk about this as being “ordered” since we can differentiate between the five roles. Instead of labelling them with their names, we could label them \\(1\\) through \\(5\\) and make the ordering more explicit.\n\nExample 3.8 (Seating in a (Not Full) Coffee Shop) Still haunted by that time when the coffee shop was full, Sadie and Charles enter the coffee shop at a later date and find that, including themselves, there are only \\(7\\) patrons in the store, and still the \\(10\\) seats to choose from.\n\nHow many different ways can the \\(7\\) people sit in the \\(10\\) different chairs?\nIf there are \\(10\\) drinks on the menu, how many different ways can each person choose a chair and a drink?\nIf the coffee shop can make only one of each drink, how does the previous total change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case we are looking to order subsets from a total collection. If we line up the \\(7\\) patrons we then need to select \\(7\\) chairs to go with them, and keep these ordered. This is \\[P_{10,7} = \\frac{10!}{3!} = 604800.\\]\nIn this part of the question we know that the \\(7\\) people have \\(P_{10,7}\\) ways of sitting into seats, we can view this as decision one. Then, for each of these \\(7\\) people there is a decision of what drink they will order. For these \\(7\\) decisions, \\(n_2 = \\cdots = n_8 = 10\\). As a result, we get the total number is \\[P_{10,7}\\times10\\times10\\times\\cdots\\times10 = P_{10,7}\\times 10^{7} = 6,048,000,000,000.\\]\nThis setting, like part (b) starts with a first decision involving \\(P_{10,7}\\) choices. Then, instead of there being \\(7\\) more decisions with \\(10\\) choices each, we can either view this as \\(7\\) more choices with a descending number of options \\(10\\) for the first, then \\(9\\), and so on, or we can view this as a single choice where we need to select \\(7\\) ordered options from the \\(10\\) drinks available. This gives \\[P_{10,7} \\times P_{10,7} = 365,783,040,000,\\] total choices.\n\n\n\n\n\nFactorials compute the number of orderings for a set of objects, and permutations compute the number of ordered subsets from a collection of objects. What about when we do not wish to differentiate the order of subsets? Suppose that you still need to form a \\(5\\) person committee, but you do not have explicit roles for the different members of the committee. Here we cannot use a permutation directly, as we know that this takes into account the order.\nTo determine the number of unordered subsets, we will consider an alternative approach that we could have used for taking ordered subsets. Suppose that we formulate the ordered committee as a two step procedure. First, we select \\(5\\) people without concern for their order. Then we choose which order they will have. If \\(M\\) represents the number of unordered sets of \\(5\\) from this population, the product rule for counting tells us that the total number of ordered committees will be \\(M\\times 5!\\), since there are \\(5!\\) arrangements of the \\(5\\) people. Thus, we can write this down as \\[P_{30,5} = \\frac{30!}{25!} = M\\times 5! \\implies M = \\frac{30!}{25!5!}.\\]\nThis will be true in general. If we want to select \\(k\\) items from a collection of \\(n\\), we will have \\(n!\\) divided by the product of \\(k!\\) and \\((n-k)!\\). We refer to these as combinations.\n\nDefinition 3.4 (Combinations) If we wish to select \\(k\\) items from a collection of \\(n\\) items, where the ordering of these selections does not matter, then the total number is referred to as a combination. Mathematically, \\[\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\\]\n\nWe read \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) as “\\(n\\) choose \\(k\\)”, which translates to “select \\(k\\) items from a population of \\(n\\) total options, without concern for their order.”\nTo summarize: factorials allow us to order a complete collection, permutations allow us to select a subset with consideration of the ordering, and combinations allow us to select a subset from the collection without regard to the order. These three techniques can be used in combination with the product rule for counting to allow us to have very complex total summations.\n\nExample 3.9 (Changing the Seating in the Coffee Shop) Some nights, the coffee shop hosts local music acts. Because of the added equipment, the coffee shop owners only keep out the number of seats that are going to be required based on the number of tickets that were sold.\n\nIf there are \\(8\\) tickets sold, how many different combinations of the \\(10\\) chairs can get left out?\nSuppose that only \\(6\\) people end up showing up. How many different ways can the \\(6\\) people sit in the \\(8\\) chairs that are being selected from the \\(10\\) total possibilities?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, there is no ordering for the \\(8\\) chairs that are to be selected. As a result, we are looking for how many chairs can be selected from a group of \\(10\\) of them. This is \\[\\binom{10}{8} = \\frac{10!}{8!\\cdot 2!} = 45.\\]\nWith the first choice having \\(45\\) possible options, the second choice that needs to be made is how \\(6\\) people sit into \\(8\\) chairs. Here the ordering does matter, since the chairs are distinguishable. As a result, this is a permutations question, with there being a total of \\(P_{8,6} = \\frac{8!}{2!}\\) ways of having the people select their seats. In total then there are \\[\\binom{10}{8}\\times P_{8,6} = \\frac{10!}{8!\\cdot 2!}\\cdot\\frac{8!}{2!} = 907,200.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.10 (Fundraiser Raffle Consultation) Charles and Sadie are asked by a local organization to help organize a raffle as a fundraiser. The organizers are considering two different versions for the raffle.\n\nThey would sell \\(1000\\) tickets, and there are \\(5\\) different prizes (valued at $1000, $500, $250, $150, and $100) respectively.\nThey would sell \\(1000\\) tickets, and draw \\(5\\) winners. Each winner would win $400.\n\nThey are curious how these two scenarios differ statistically.\n\nHow many possible winning combinations exist for scenario 1?\nHow many possible winning combinations exist for scenario 2?\nAre the probabilities that any specific individual wins the raffle different between the two versions? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first scenario, the ordering of the winners matters. We can think of drawing the \\(5\\) winners in order from highest value prize to lowest value prize. Then, we are selecting \\(k=5\\) from \\(n=1000\\) with concern for ordering, so the total number of winning combinations is \\[P_{1000,5} = \\frac{1000!}{995!} = 990,034,950,024,000.\\]\nIn the second scenario, the ordering of the winners does not matter. There is no distinction between the winners, and so we could select any \\(5\\) and then report the winners alphabetically. Then, we are selecting \\(k=5\\) from \\(n=1000\\) with no concern for ordering, so the total number of winning combinations is \\[\\binom{1000}{5} = \\frac{1000!}{5!995!} = 8,250,291,250,200.\\]\nIntuitively, the probabilities should be the same. Moreover, it makes sense that each probability should be \\(5/1000\\) since the probability of winning any of the prizes is \\(1/1000\\) and there are \\(5\\) such prizes to win.\nIn parts (a) and (b) we saw the total number of each version, and we know that any sequence of winners is equally likely. As a result, we can consider counting the total number of ways that any specific individual can win in both scenarios. In the first, suppose that the individual wins the top prize. Then we need to select 4 other winners (with ordering) from the remaining \\(999\\) individuals. Thus, the total number of ways that they can win the $1000 prize is \\(P_{999,4}\\). The same goes for all of the other prizes, meaning the total number of ways that they can win is \\(5\\times P_{999,4}\\). Thus, the probability that they win is \\[\\frac{5P_{999,4}}{P_{1000,5}} = \\frac{5(999!/995!)}{1000!/995!} = \\frac{5}{1000}.\\]\nFor the second option, if we know that the particular individual wins then we need to select the other \\(4\\) winners from the remaining \\(999\\) individuals, without concern for the ordering. Thus, there are \\(\\dbinom{999}{4}\\) winning combinations for the specific individual, and the probability that they win is \\[\\frac{\\binom{999}{4}}{\\binom{1000}{5}} = \\frac{999! \\times 5! \\times 995!}{995!\\times 4! \\times 1000!} = \\frac{5}{1000}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Less Common Counting Techniques\nWhile most of the problems we address will revolve around permutations and combinations (with heavy use of the product rule), there are additional techniques which are important to know (and recognize when to use). In particular, combinations and permutations each assume that we are sampling from our set without replacement. That is, each time you select an item, it is removed from the population. These are the most common situations in these combinatorial problems, however, there are some situations which arise where we need to count the number of ordered or unordered subsets with replacement.\n\n3.4.5.1 Ordered Subsets with Replacement\nConsider, for instance, forming a password using only lowercase numbers and letters. If you decide on a fixed length for the password, then there are going to be \\(36\\) choices at each decision point, and you want to take an ordered subset of these. This is forming an ordered subset with replacement, and to count how many different ways there are of doing this, we can use the product rule. That is, you have \\(36\\) choices at each decision point, and so there are \\(36\\times 36\\times\\cdots\\times 36 = 36^k\\) total decisions, where \\(k\\) is the number of items to select.\nIn general, if you have \\(n\\) total items and you want to make an ordered set of \\(k\\) of these items with replacement you will have \\(n^k\\) total ways of doing this.\n\n\n3.4.5.2 Unordered Subsets with Replacement\nForming unordered sets with replacement is slightly less intuitive. Consider rolling \\(k\\) dice which are not distinguishable from one another. We know that there are \\(6\\) total sides that can show up on each of these dice, but how many different combinations of numbers can show up overall? If the dice can be distinguished we would say that there are \\(6^k\\) possible ways of doing this. However, some of these combinations are going to be equivalent in the unordered world. Take the simple case of \\(k=2\\). Here we have the following possibilities: \\[\\begin{align*}\n(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)&\\\\\n(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)&\\\\\n(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)&\\\\\n(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)&\\\\\n(5, 5), (5, 6)&\\\\\n(6,6)&\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis gives a total of \\(21\\) possible combinations, rather than \\(36\\).\nIn general, if we want to find the way of selecting \\(k\\) elements with replacement from a total of \\(n\\), then the number of ways of doing this will be \\[\\binom{n+k-1}{k}.\\] In our example this gives \\(\\binom{6+2-1}{2} = 21\\).\n\n\n3.4.5.3 Permutations with Identical Objects\nFinally, it is worth understanding how to handle identical objects in combinatorial problems. Suppose that, of the \\(10\\) books that we wish to place on a shelf, we have \\(2\\) copies of one of them, \\(3\\) copies of another one, and the other \\(5\\) have one copy each. Supposing that there is no way to tell these identical objects apart, how many ways can we arrange the bookshelf?\nFirst, if we pretend that all of the items are actually able to be differentiated then there are \\(10!\\) ways of placing these books. Now, in any of these permutations, had we swapped the order of the first book (with \\(2\\) copies) the ordering would have been indistinguishable. As a result, for every ordering of the \\(8\\) other books, we counted that permutation twice (when it should have only been counted once!). So to address the two repeated copies we need to take \\(10!/2\\). Now, a similar argument is going to hold for the book with \\(3\\) repeated copies. However, instead of there being \\(2\\) permutations which are identical, there are going to be \\(3! = 6\\) permutations which are identical. This is because we can reorder the \\(3\\) copies of the book in anyway we choose, and still wind up with the same overall permutation.17 As a result, the total number is going to be \\[\\frac{10!}{2!\\cdot3!} = 302400.\\]\nWe can see this same result through an alternative construction. First, we select which of the \\(10\\) slots should have the first book. We do not care about the order, and so there are \\(\\binom{10}{2}\\) ways of doing this. Next, we can select which of the \\(8\\) remaining slots should have the second book. Like the first one there will be \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\) ways of placing these. Now, there are \\(5\\) slots remaining, and \\(5\\) books to place, so as a result, we can order those in \\(5!\\) different ways, and then slot them into the remaining places in order. This gives, in total \\[\\binom{10}{2}\\binom{8}{3}(5!) = \\frac{10!}{2!\\cancel{8!}}\\cdot\\frac{\\cancel{8!}}{3!\\cancel{5!}}\\cdot\\cancel{5!} = \\frac{10!}{2!3!}.\\]\nTo generalize this, if we want to order \\(n\\) elements, such that there are \\(k\\) distinguishable elements with \\(n_1\\) of the first type, \\(n_2\\) of the second, and so forth until \\(n_k\\) of the last type (\\(n = n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_k\\)), then the total number of orderings will be \\[\\frac{n!}{n_1!\\cdot n_2!\\cdots n_k!}.\\]",

    "text": "3.5 From Combinatorics to Probability\nWhile combinatorics is a field of study on its own, with many intriguing tools and developments surrounding the enumeration of objects, for the purposes of simple probability models these tools will suffice. Ultimately, we care about counting since in the equal probability model, the probability of any event can be determined by counting the number of ways that the event can occur and dividing by the total number of outcomes that are possible. That is, we use these tools to derive \\(N_A\\), the total number of ways that \\(A\\) can occur, and \\(N\\), the total number of experimental outcomes, and then we conclude that \\[P(A) = \\frac{N_A}{N}.\\]\n\nExample 3.11 (Poker Hand Counts) During one of their conversations, Charles and Sadie were remarking how they never really played poker. As they understand it, in poker you are dealt a hand of \\(5\\) cards and you want to use these \\(5\\) cards to try to match certain sets of cards, some of which are more rare than others. Charles and Sadie start to get hung-up on discussions regarding “straights” and “flushes”.\nA straight is any sequence of \\(5\\) cards in ascending order (where aces can be low, or high). For instance, \\(7, 8, 9, 10, \\text{J}\\) of any suit. A flush, is any set of \\(5\\) cards belonging to the same suit. Charles just feels that straights have to be more rare than flushes.\n\nHow many different straights are there from a standard deck of cards?\nHow many different flushes are there from a standard deck of cards?\nIf dealt \\(5\\) cards at random, what is the probability of a flush? What is the probability of a straight?\nA straight flush occurs when you have \\(5\\) cards in order, of the same suit. What is the probability of a straight flush?\nIf straight flushes were not counted as flushes, and not counted as straights, how do the probabilities of either hand change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA straight necessitates drawing five cards in order, with each of any suit. Just as with the straight flush, there are \\(10\\) possible starting values for the straight. Once we have selected the starting value, then for each of the five cards we can pick any of the four suits, resulting in \\(4\\) choices each. That gives \\[N_A = 10\\times 4\\times 4\\times 4\\times 4\\times 4 = 10\\times 4^5 = 10240.\\]\nA flush necessitates drawing any five cards from the same suit. If we had a suit fixed, there would be \\({13\\choose 5}\\) ways of doing this, since we do not care about ordering. If we think about first choosing the suit, we have \\(4\\) ways of doing that, resulting in \\[N_A = 4 \\times {13 \\choose 5} = 5148.\\]\nTo find the probabilities of each of these, we need to know the total number of \\(5\\) card hands. We do not consider order, and so \\(N = \\binom{52}{5} = 2598960\\). Then, the probability is the number of combinations (calculated above) divided by the number of hands. This gives, for straights, \\[P(A) = \\frac{10240}{2598960} = \\frac{128}{32487} \\approx 0.00394,\\] and for flushes, \\[P(A) = \\frac{5148}{2598960} = \\frac{33}{16660} \\approx 0.00198.\\] As a result, we see that straights are roughly twice as common as flushes are.18\nNote that to form a straight flush, we first have to fix a suit. There are \\({4\\choose 1}=4\\) total ways of doing this. Next, we need to pick which starting value we will use. Once a card has been selected as a starting value, the remaining cards are fixed. The start value ranges from A through to \\(10\\). Correspondingly, we have \\[N_A = {4\\choose 1}{10 \\choose 1} = 4\\times10 = 40.\\] As a result, we get that \\[P(A) = \\frac{40}{2598960} = \\frac{1}{64974}.\\]\nFrom (d) exactly \\(40\\) of the straights and \\(40\\) of the flushes are also straight flushes. We can thus remove \\(40\\) from the totals of each of these, giving \\(\\dfrac{10200}{2598960}\\) for straights and \\(\\dfrac{5108}{2598960}\\) for flushes.",

    "text": "Or else conclude that I was mistaken and maybe should not be teaching probability.↩︎\nOne of the most famous quotes from a statistician was a thought shared by John Tukey, stating “The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard.” This is a common refrain, and one rooted in truth. Statistics is everywhere, across every field of human inquiry, and can help us make sense of everything from the trivial to the deeply important.↩︎\nThis does not help to explain why we use urns so much, of course. When was the last time any of us drew a ball from an urn?↩︎\nNote that, when we have a set, using the absolute value symbols \\(|\\cdot|\\) stands for the cardinality of the set. Cardinality is just a fancy way of saying the size or the number of elements that the set has in it.↩︎\nA quantity which in the equally likely outcome framework, we know exactly.↩︎\nThe sample function can also be used without equally likely events by specifying a vector of probabilities, however, this is a less common use case.↩︎\nFor instance, the Queen of spades being drawn.↩︎\nThis is actually a scenario where our instincts may lead us awry in some situations. Consider the following from Kahneman and Tversky (1972): Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Which is more probable? (a) Linda is a bank teller, or (b) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. A majority of respondents rate (b) as being more probable, even though (a) is contained in (b).↩︎\nThese rules, which we call “properties” are formally known as “axioms”.↩︎\nWhat would it mean to have a negative probability? It is perhaps a more interesting question than it seems at first glance. It is a topic that has come up in some pretty strange places and, while it is not presently sensible to call them “probabilities” in a traditional sense, there are interesting results which follow.↩︎\nNote: if this is not yet clear to you, that’s okay! In the very next section we begin to discuss how to count the possible combinations in these types of scenarios.↩︎\nSuppose that \\(d_1 = 2\\) and \\(d_2 = 4\\). Then here, the dice can match when they show either \\(1\\) or \\(2\\), but if the second die shows \\(3\\) or \\(4\\) there is no possibility of having a match at all.↩︎\nFactorials are exciting because they always look like they are shouting!↩︎\nIt is somewhat interesting to note how large these values get relatively quickly. This is a comparatively small question: only \\(10\\) people with \\(10\\) drinks and \\(10\\) snacks. If you consider any counting problem with a larger number of items, these problems quickly grow to be intensely complex. For instance, a count of my main home book collection reveals \\(376\\) of them. To order these would give \\(376!\\) possible orderings. In decimal representation this is \\[4.992244775852435618292576458782762114148884082811840265632\\dots\\times10^{806}.\\] This is an \\(807\\) digit long number. This is an incomprehensibly large number. This number is \\(8×10^{726}\\) times larger than the number of atoms in the universe. That is, if every atom in the universe were given some arrangements of books to hold onto, they would need to hold \\(8×10^{726}\\) of them in order for all of the arrangements to be held. I point this out because combinatorics explodes in this way. Even simple problems grow out of hand very, very quickly. This is where comfort with the algebraic tools is required, rather than a reliance on intuition. There is simply no way to have intuition regarding the scope of these numbers, at least, not without a lot of practice.↩︎\nImagine I am placing books on my shelf. With \\(3\\) books there are \\(3! = 6\\) ways my shelf can look at the end. With \\(2\\) books there are \\(2! = 2\\) ways my shelf can look at the end. With \\(1\\) book there are \\(1! = 1\\) ways my shelf can look at the end. With \\(0\\) books there are \\(0! = 1\\) ways my shelf can look at the end.↩︎\nNote, this does not help us with the factorials of negative numbers, nor of fractional numbers. Factorials can be extended to these in sensible ways, but these are not for combinatorial purposes and are no longer “factorials” exactly.↩︎\nIn fact, the reason that there are \\(2\\) ways of doing this with the book with \\(2\\) copies is since \\(2! = 2\\).↩︎\nThis is still a deeply unintuitive result to me. To me it feels like it should be harder to get a nice ordering of cards all in a row than it is to find ones of the same suit. And yet, it is about twice as likely to have the straights. Now, if you think about this deeply, it makes a lot of sense: there is a lot more leeway in selecting the straight than the flush. However, my brain refuses to accept this as intuitive. This is something that can often occur in probability questions where the true results can be far from what we would expect. An interesting question is how long does a straight have to be to be less likely than a flush of the same length. Note that the number of ways of choosing a flush will always be \\(4\\times\\binom{13}{k}\\), and the number of ways of forming a straight will always be \\(10\\times 4^k\\). If we consider \\(k\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(13\\), we can take the ratios of these to see just how much more (or less) likely a straight is. Doing this gives: k=1 gives 0.769. k=2 gives 0.513. k=3 gives 0.559. k=4 gives 0.895. k=5 gives 1.989. k=6 gives 5.967. k=7 gives 23.869. k=8 gives 127.304. k=9 gives 916.587. k=10 gives 9165.874. k=11 gives 134432.821. k=12 gives 3226387.692. k=13 gives 167772160. Up to (and including) \\(4\\) cards the straight is indeed harder to achieve. However, this does not last long!↩︎",

    "text": "4.1 Marginal and Joint Probabilities\nUp until this point we have primarily focused on assigning probabilities to particular events. If we have some event of interest, \\(A\\), then \\(P(A)\\) is the probability that \\(A\\) occurs in any manner. If we are using our equally likely probability model, then \\(P(A) = \\dfrac{N_A}{N}\\). This is the probability of the event \\(A\\) where nothing else is known at all. If we smooth over anything which could alter the likelihood, if we have no additional information, if we want the best guess for the likelihood of occurrence in a vacuum, this is the probability of interest. We refer to such quantities as marginal probabilities.\nIt is useful to specifically call these marginal probabilities to differentiate them from probabilities which depend on two or more events. Specifically, we can think about taking the intersection of two events, say \\(A \\cap B\\). In words this is the event that \\(A\\) occurs and \\(B\\) occurs. Until this point we have thought about solving for probabilities related to intersections as a two-step procedure: first, find an event \\(C = A \\cap B\\), and then second solve for the marginal probability of \\(C\\). While this is a useful technique for calculation, sometimes it is more useful to think of the probability of the intersection as the probability of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occurring simultaneously.

    "section": "4.2 What are Conditional Probabilities?",
    "text": "4.2 What are Conditional Probabilities?\nMarginal probabilities are often of interest, and frequently are the best tool for summarizing the overall state of the world, or our knowledge regarding the state of the world. Joint probabilities can be useful when working with compound events, or thinking of complex outcomes. However, there are many scenarios which are not covered by either the joint or marginal probabilities. In practice we know that sometimes information that we have will change our understanding of the probability of an event.\nSuppose the event \\(A\\) corresponds to the event that it snows tomorrow, in some particular city. It is possible to think about how often it snows on average, and report a value related to that as \\(P(A)\\). Now, what if we know that it is currently the middle of summer, and the city is in the Norther Hemisphere? In this case, while \\(P(A)\\) does not shrink to \\(0\\), it becomes far less likely than if we did not have that information. Similarly, if we know that it is winter in the same city, the likelihood that it snows tomorrow increases. In order to formally capture this we can introduce the idea of conditional probability.\n\nDefinition 4.3 (Conditional Probability) The conditional probability of an event \\(A\\) given an event \\(B\\), is the probability that \\(A\\) occurs assuming that we know that \\(B\\) occurs. The conditional probability takes into account additional information codified through the occurrence of an additional event. We write this quantity as \\(P(A|B)\\), and will read this as “the probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\).”\n\nUnlike in the case of marginal probabilities, conditional probabilities allow us to condition on extra pieces of information. Instead of asking “what is the probability of this event”, we instead ask, “given that we know this piece of information, what is the probability of this event?” Joint probabilities ask “what is the probability that both of these events occur simultaneously” which is distinct in that we do not have any additional information about the state of the world when working with joint probabilities. The subtle distinction becomes quite powerful, both in terms of manipulating and working with probabilities, but also in terms of expressing the correct events of interest for ourselves.\nTo make use of conditional probabilities, we will think of the process of conditioning on one or more events. We will talk of the probability of \\(A\\) conditional on \\(B\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two events of interest. Intuitively, this it the probability of \\(A\\) happening, supposing that we know that \\(B\\) has already happened.\n\nExample 4.1 (Six from the Sum) Charles and Sadie are playing a new game using two dice. In the game they each take turns rolling the two dice into a container that the other player cannot see. They add up the dice and then report this sum to the other player. The other player then has to guess whether or not there is a six showing.\n\nOn one round, Charles does not hear the sum that Sadie reports as he was not paying attention. Sadie is strict and insists that she will not repeat herself. What should Charles guess?\nDetermine a strategy which optimizes the likelihood that the guessing player will be correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case we want the marginal probability of a six showing up on the roll of two dice. Take \\(E\\) to represent the event wherein at least one six is showing on the roll of two dice. Thus, \\(E^C\\) is the event that no sixes are showing. There are \\(5\\times 5=25\\) (using the product rule for counting) ways of not rolling a \\(6\\), meaning that \\[P(E^C) = \\dfrac{25}{36} \\implies P(E) = 1 - \\dfrac{25}{36} = \\dfrac{11}{36}.\\] Thus, Charles should guess that there is no \\(6\\) as the probability is only \\(11/36 \\approx 0.31\\).\nHere we wish to determine conditional probabilities. We take \\(E\\) to be the event that at least one \\(6\\) is showing, and then \\(S\\) to be a variable representing the sum of the two dice. For \\(s= 1, \\dots, 12\\) we wish to find \\(P(E|\\{S=s\\})\\). Notice that for \\(s=2,\\dots,6\\) \\(P(E|S=s) = 0\\). If the sum is \\(2\\) we know that there could not have been a \\(6\\). Moreover, for \\(s=11,12\\) we know that \\(P(E|S=s) = 1\\) since the only way to form \\(11\\) is a five and a six, and the only way to form \\(12\\) is to have two sixes. This leaves \\(s = 7,\\dots,10\\) to check. The following table gives the set of values, the possible combinations to reach the value, and then the combinations that end up involving a \\(6\\).\n\n\n\nValue\nCombinations\nInvolving 6\n\n\n\n\n7\n(1,6) (2,5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1)\n(1, 6) (6, 1)\n\n\n8\n(2,6) (3,5) (4, 4) (5, 3) (6, 2)\n(2, 6) (6, 2)\n\n\n9\n(3,6) (4,5) (5, 4) (6, 3)\n(2, 6) (6, 2)\n\n\n10\n(4, 6) (5, 5) (6, 4)\n(4, 6) (6, 4)\n\n\n\nReferencing from this table we can read off the following probabilities \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(E|S=7) &= \\dfrac{2}{6} = \\dfrac{1}{3}\\\\\nP(E|S=8) &= \\dfrac{2}{5} \\\\\nP(E|S=9) &= \\dfrac{2}{4} \\\\\nP(E|S=10) &= \\dfrac{2}{3}.\n\\end{align*}\\] As a result, the best strategy is to guess “yes” when a \\(10\\), \\(11\\), or \\(12\\) is rolled and to be indifferent to the guess when a \\(9\\) is rolled. Otherwise, guess “no.”\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), as events, are merely subsets of the sample space, \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). Each item in either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is one of the possible outcomes from the experiment or process that we are observing. Suppose that we know that \\(B\\) has occurred. What this means is that, one of the outcomes in the set \\(B\\) was the observed outcome from the experiment. Now, if we want to know \\(P(A|B)\\), we want to know the probability, working from the assumption that \\(B\\) has happened, that \\(A\\) also happens. That is, knowing that \\(B\\) has happened, what is the probability that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) both happen.\nThe event that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) both happen is denoted by the intersection, \\(A \\cap B\\). This corresponds to the set of events inside the set \\(B\\) which also belong to the set \\(A\\). Now, instead of considering the joint probability directly, we need to acknowledge that for \\(A|B\\), only the events in \\(B\\) were possible. That is, instead of being divided by the whole space, we can only divide by the space of \\(B\\). In some sense, we can view conditioning on \\(B\\) as treating \\(B\\) as though it is the full sample space, and finding probabilities within that. In general, \\(B\\) will be smaller than \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), and so \\(P(B) &lt; 1\\). Instead of the conditional probability being “out of” \\(1\\), it will instead be “out of” \\(P(B)\\), which gives \\(P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing Conditional Probabilities\n\n\n\nFor an event \\(A\\), and an event \\(B\\) with probability \\(P(B) &gt; 0\\), the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) is \\[P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}.\\]\n\n\nTo make this more clear, suppose that we take \\(A\\) to be the event that a \\(2\\) is rolled on a fair, six-sided die, and \\(B\\) to be the event that an even number was rolled. This is an equal probability model, and so each outcome gets \\(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\) probability. The original sample space is \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\), the event \\(A\\) is \\(\\{2\\}\\), and the event \\(B\\) is \\(\\{2,4,6\\}\\). In order for both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to occur, we note that we need \\(A \\cap B = \\{2\\}\\). If we know that \\(B\\) has occurred, then we know that either a \\(2\\), \\(4\\), or \\(6\\) has been rolled, with equal probability for each. Thus, intuitively, we can view \\(B\\) as the new sample space, and say that rolling a \\(2\\) has a \\(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\) probability, given that there are \\(3\\) outcomes and \\(1\\) of them is the event of interest.\nWe can also compute this directly. Note that \\(P(B) = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\), and so we need to scale each event by \\(\\dfrac{1}{1/2}\\) in order to make sure that the total probability of our reduced sample space equals \\(1\\). Then \\(P(A\\cap B) = \\dfrac{1}{6}\\), so \\[P(A|B) = \\dfrac{1/6}{1/2} = \\dfrac{1}{3}.\\]\nSuppose that, instead of a fair die, it was weighted so that \\(6\\) comes up more frequently than the other options. Consider the probability of observing a six to be \\(0.5\\), with the other five values each coming up with probability \\(0.10\\). If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same events as above, then \\(P(B) = 0.7\\).\nIf we know that \\(B\\) has occurred then the new sample space is \\(\\{2,4,6\\}\\) where \\(P(2) = \\dfrac{0.1}{0.7} = \\dfrac{1}{7}\\), \\(P(4) = \\dfrac{0.1}{0.7} = \\dfrac{1}{7}\\), and \\(P(6) = \\dfrac{0.5}{0.7} = \\dfrac{5}{7}\\). Note that these three probabilities sum to \\(1\\) still, which constitutes a valid probability model, and so \\(P(A|B) = \\dfrac{1}{7}\\).\n\nExample 4.2 (Six from the Sum - Revisited) Sadie sees the solution worked out for the best strategy in the dice game above, but is having trouble understanding it in the context of conditional probability more broadly. For the sums \\(7, 8, 9\\), and \\(10\\), describe the process of limiting the sample space to get the correct conditional probability, and use the formula to show that the probabilities worked out in Example 4.1 are correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relevant table of solutions is copied from above.\n\n\n\nValue\nCombinations\nInvolving 6\n\n\n\n\n7\n(1,6) (2,5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1)\n(1, 6) (6, 1)\n\n\n8\n(2,6) (3,5) (4, 4) (5, 3) (6, 2)\n(2, 6) (6, 2)\n\n\n9\n(3,6) (4,5) (5, 4) (6, 3)\n(2, 6) (6, 2)\n\n\n10\n(4, 6) (5, 5) (6, 4)\n(4, 6) (6, 4)\n\n\n\nHere, given a sum, we know that one of the events listed under “combinations” has occurred. As a result, once we have conditioned on what the sum is, we are able to treat the “combinations” column as the full sample space of possible outcomes. Each of these in this case is equally likely, and so we can divide the number which contain a \\(6\\), by the total number in the reduced sample space.\nTo do this algebraically, we first note that \\[\\begin{align*}\n    P(S=7) &= \\dfrac{6}{36} \\\\\n    P(S=8) &= \\dfrac{5}{36} \\\\\n    P(S=9) &= \\dfrac{4}{36} \\\\\n    P(S=10) &= \\dfrac{3}{36}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Now, suppose we consider the event \\(E\\cap\\{S=7\\}\\). This is the set \\(\\{(1,6),(6,1)\\}\\) and so \\(P(E\\cap\\{S=7\\}) = 2/36\\). In fact, the same holds true for all of the joint events. As a result, we get \\[\\begin{align*}\n    P(E|S=7) &= \\dfrac{\\dfrac{2}{36}}{\\dfrac{6}{36}} = \\dfrac{2}{6} \\\\\n    P(E|S=8) &= \\dfrac{\\dfrac{2}{36}}{\\dfrac{5}{36}} = \\dfrac{2}{5} \\\\\n    P(E|S=9) &= \\dfrac{\\dfrac{2}{36}}{\\dfrac{4}{36}} = \\dfrac{2}{4} \\\\\n    P(E|S=10) &= \\dfrac{\\dfrac{2}{36}}{\\dfrac{3}{36}} = \\dfrac{2}{3}.\n\\end{align*}\\] This corresponds exactly to the values we found before.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, we wish to condition on more than one event. To do so, the same process extends naturally. For instance, suppose we want to know the probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). This would be written \\[P(A|B,C) = \\dfrac{P(A\\cap B\\cap C)}{P(B \\cap C)} = \\dfrac{P(A,B,C)}{P(B,C)}.\\] Moving beyond two events occurs in the expected way.",

    "text": "4.3 Using Conditional Probabilities\nConditional probability is a mechanism for capturing our knowledge of the world, and using that to update our sense of the uncertainties at play. For instance, suppose that we are interested in drawing a random card from a deck of \\(52\\), and we want to know the probability that it is a heart. Without any additional knowledge, the probability of this event is \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\). Now, suppose that you know that it is a red card. In this case, we now know that it is either a heart or a diamond, and there are equal numbers of each, meaning that the new probability is \\(0.5\\). We can work this out directly \\[P(\\text{Heart}|\\text{Red}) = \\dfrac{P(\\text{Heart},\\text{Red})}{P(\\text{Red})} = \\dfrac{P(\\text{Heart})}{1/2} = \\dfrac{1/4}{1/2} = 0.5.\\] Suppose instead that we had been told that the card was an ace. Here we now know that there are four possible outcomes that correspond to an ace, and only one of these is a heart, meaning the probability is \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\). In this case, \\(P(A|B) = P(A)\\), and our beliefs did not update.\nWhat if instead we had considered the second event to be “the card was a spade.” In this case if we want to know \\(P(A|B)\\) then, given a spade being drawn, we know that the probability of drawing a heart is \\(0\\).\n\nExample 4.3 (Charles’s Mismatched Urn Mishap) Charles’s love of probability prompts a spontaneous decision: buy an urn and some coloured balls to fill it up with. Unfortunately, the supplier of the balls misunderstood the request and sent over an assortment of different shapes rather than just spheres. There are some spheres, some cubes, some pyramids, and some cones. There are also five different colours present, red, blue, green, yellow, and black. Charles is slightly dismayed as, when reaching into the urn, it is very easy to feel what shape you are pulling out before you see the object, and the distribution of colour-shape combinations is not even. Despite the dismay, Charles shows Sadie, who is deeply excited, explaining how this mismatched urn is perfect for understanding conditional probabilities deeply. The distribution of shapes and colours is presented in the following table.\n\n\n\nColour\nSphere\nCube\nPyramid\nCone\n\n\n\n\nRed\n2\n3\n2\n0\n\n\nBlue\n1\n0\n0\n6\n\n\nGreen\n2\n2\n1\n2\n\n\nYellow\n0\n4\n2\n1\n\n\nBlack\n3\n1\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability of drawing each colour, if items are selected at random, without knowledge of the shape?\nAssuming that the shape is known, what is the probability of selecting each colour?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that there are \\(2+3+2=7\\) red, \\(1+6=7\\) blue, \\(2+2+1+2=7\\) green, \\(4+2+1=7\\) yellow, and \\(3+1+1+2=7\\) black objects. As a result, each colour is going to be equally likely, with a probability of \\(0.2\\).\nTake \\(S\\), \\(C\\), \\(P\\), \\(Cn\\) to be the events that a sphere, cube, pyramid, or cone are drawn, respectively. Take \\(R\\), \\(B\\), \\(G\\), \\(Y\\), \\(Bk\\) to be the events that a red, blue, green, yellow, or black object is drawn, respectively. We want the probability of each colour, given the corresponding shape. There are a total of \\(20\\) conditional probabilities to solve for here. We walk through, in full, the first conditional probability calculation. Afterwards, the same process follows to get the (provided) answer.\nFirst note that there are \\(8\\) spheres, \\(10\\) cubes, \\(6\\) pyramids, and \\(11\\) cones. Thus, the marginal probabilities are \\(P(S) = 8/35\\), \\(P(C) = 10/35\\), \\(P(P) = 6/35\\), and \\(P(Cn) = 11/35\\). Note further that the joint probability between any colour-shape combination is going to be given by the number of that combination that exist, divided by \\(35\\). Thus, suppose we want \\(P(R|S)\\). There are \\(2\\) red spheres, so \\(P(R \\cap S) = 2/35\\). The marginal probability \\(P(S) = 8/35\\), so taken together this gives \\[P(R|S) = \\dfrac{2/35}{8/35} = \\dfrac{2}{8} = \\dfrac{1}{4}.\\]\nApplying the same process gives the following probabilities, reported in the table for convenience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColour\nSphere\nCube\nPyramid\nCone\n\n\n\n\nRed\n\\(\\dfrac{2}{8} = \\dfrac{1}{4}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{3}{10}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\nBlue\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{8}\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{6}{11}\\)\n\n\nGreen\n\\(\\dfrac{2}{8} = \\dfrac{1}{4}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{5}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{2}{11}\\)\n\n\nYellow\n\\(0\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{11}\\)\n\n\nBlack\n\\(\\dfrac{3}{8}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{10}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{2}{11}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 The Multiplication Rule\nWhile sometimes we will want to work out the conditional probability using our knowledge of the joint and marginal probabilities, there are other times where it is easier to determine the conditional probability directly. In these settings we may wish to understand the marginal or joint probabilities. That is, we may know \\(P(A|B)\\), but we want to make statements regarding \\(P(A)\\) or \\(P(A,B)\\).\nTo do so, we can rearrange the defining relationship of conditional probability, to solve for the quantities of interest. Because of the importance of this procedure, we actually give this mostly straightforward rearrangement a special name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiplication Rule\n\n\n\nThe multiplication rule states that, for two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) where \\(P(B) &gt; 0\\), \\[P(A\\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B).\\]\n\n\nNote that, by multiplying both sides of the definition of \\(P(A|B)\\) by \\(P(B)\\) gives the result. In words it states that we can solve for the joint probability of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) by multiplying the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\), by the marginal probability of \\(B\\). This is symmetric in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) so that \\[P(A\\cap B) = P(B|A)P(A).\\] This is useful as sometimes it is easier to determine \\(B\\) given \\(A\\).\n\nExample 4.4 (Package Delivery Times) To thank Sadie for the help in seeing the silver lining with the urn mishap, Charles decides to order a small gift online, sending it direct to Sadie. Unfortunately, the website does not list which delivery company each package is sent out with. After some sleuthing, Charles determines that there are two different companies that it may have been sent with. Looking at online reviews it appears as though company \\(A\\) is late \\(75\\%\\) of the time while company \\(B\\) is late \\(15\\%\\) of the time.\nIf the store that Charles ordered from sends out \\(10\\%\\) of packages with company \\(A\\), and the rest with company \\(B\\), which is more likely: that the package is late and was sent with \\(A\\), or that the package was late and sent with \\(B\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will take \\(L\\) to correspond to the events where the package is late, \\(A\\) to the events where the package was sent with \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to be the events where the package was sent with \\(B\\). We wish to compare \\(P(L, A)\\) and \\(P(L, B)\\). We know that \\(P(A) = 0.1\\) and \\(P(B) = 0.9\\), and we know that \\(P(L|A) = 0.75\\) and \\(P(L|B) = 0.15\\). As a result, we can use the multiplication rule to find the joint probabilities.\nFirst, \\[P(L, A) = P(L|A)P(A) = (0.75)(0.1) = 0.075.\\] Additionally, \\[P(L, B) = P(L|B)P(B) = (0.15)(0.9) = 0.135.\\]\nAs a result it is more likely to have the package late and sent with \\(B\\) then the package late and sent with \\(A\\).1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Partitions and the Law of Total Probability\nWhile the multiplication rule gives us the capacity to solve for joint probabilities, often we wish to make statements regarding marginal probabilities. Fortunately, we can extend the process outlined in the multiplication rule to solve directly for marginal probabilities as well. To do so, we first introduce the concept of a partition.\n\nDefinition 4.4 (Partition) A partition is a collection of sets which divide up the sample space such that all of the sets are disjoint from one another, and the sample space is given by the union of all of the sets. That is, \\(A_1,\\dots,A_n\\) is a partition of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) if:\n\n\\(A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset\\) for all \\(i \\neq j\\), and\n\\[\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i = \\mathcal{S}.\\]\n\n\nFor instance, if the sample space were all the positive integers, we could partition this space into all the even numbers as one set and all the odd numbers as a second. We could also partition this into the set of numbers which are less than \\(10\\), the set of numbers that are greater than \\(10\\), and then \\(10\\). In both examples we have sets whose union forms the full sample space with no overlap. Note that we could not partition the set into multiples of \\(2\\) and multiples of \\(3\\), since (i) not all values are contained between these two sets,2 and (ii) there is overlap between these two sets.3\n\nExample 4.5 (Partitions of the Coin Game) Charles and Sadie are thinking back with fondness to their original coin flipping game, where they would toss a coin three times in a row. If two or more heads showed up, Charles would pay. Otherwise, Sadie would.\nTo help them reminisce, write down three different partitions of the sample space, each with a different number of partitioning sets. Describe your partitions using words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many possible partitions to write down. The following are examples.\n\nWe can partition the space into games where Charles pays and games where Sadie pays. This gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nB_1 &= \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H}), (\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{H}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{H})\\}\\\\\nB_2 &= \\{(\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{T}), (\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{H}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{T})\\}.\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can partition the space into those with \\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(2\\), or \\(3\\) heads. This gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nB_1 &= \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H})\\}\\\\\nB_2 &= \\{(\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{H}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{T})\\}\\\\\nB_3 &= \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{H}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{H})\\}\\\\\nB_4 &= \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H})\\}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can partition the space into the number of times the sequence switches between heads and tails. There will be either \\(0\\) switches, \\(1\\) switch, or \\(2\\) switches. This gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nB_1 &= \\{(\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H}), (\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H})\\}\\\\\nB_2 &= \\{(\\text{T},\\text{T},\\text{H}), (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{T}), (\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{T}), (\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{H})\\}\\\\\nB_3 &= \\{(\\text{T},\\text{H},\\text{T}),  (\\text{H},\\text{T},\\text{H})\\}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nPartitions allow us to move from discussions regarding the joint probability of events to the marginal probability of an event. Suppose that we have a partition given by \\(B_1, B_2, \\dots\\). This means that our full sample space can be cut up into these various non-overlapping sets, and every single outcome belongs to exactly one of them. Now, suppose we are interested in some other event \\(A\\). We can ask: how can \\(A\\) occur, in terms of the events \\(B_1, B_2, \\dots\\)?\nSince every single event in the sample space belongs to exactly one of our partitioning sets, then it must be the case that every single event in \\(A\\) belongs to exactly one of our partitioning sets. This means that if we consider \\(A\\cap B_j\\), for all \\(j\\), then every single event in \\(A\\) must belong to exactly one of these. In other words, it must be the case that \\[A = \\bigcup_{j} A\\cap B_j,\\] for any partition \\(B_1, B_2,\\dots\\). Moreover, every single \\(A\\cap B_j\\) is disjoint from every other \\(A \\cap B_\\ell\\), whenever \\(\\ell \\neq j\\). This means that we can use the axiom of additivity to give \\[P(A) = P\\left(\\bigcup_{j} A\\cap B_j\\right) = \\sum_{j} P(A \\cap B_j).\\] In other words: the marginal probability of \\(A\\) can be found by summing over all joint probabilities between \\(A\\) and sets that form a partition. This argument gives the law of total probability.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: This graphic shows the argument that summing over the joint probabilities between an event and a partition gives the full marginal probability. Note that \\(B_1,\\dots,B_7\\) forms a partition of the space where every possible outcome is contained in exactly one of these sets. Then, if we take an arbitrary event \\(A\\), we can divide \\(A\\) into the components that intersect with each partitioning set, namely \\(A \\cap B_1\\), \\(A \\cap B_2\\), and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Law of Total Probability\n\n\n\nGiven a partition, \\(B_1, B_2, \\dots\\), and an event \\(A\\), the law of total probability states that \\[P(A) = \\sum_i P(A, B_i) = \\sum_i P(A|B_i)P(B_i).\\]\n\n\nIntuitively, since the whole sample space is divided into the different \\(B_i\\)s, this rule breaks down the calculation of \\(A\\) happening into manageable chunks. Each term in the summation is “the probability that \\(A\\) happens, given \\(B_i\\) happening” weighted by how likely it is that \\(B_i\\) happens. Then by summing over all possible \\(B_i\\), we know that we must be capturing all possible ways that \\(A\\) can occur since all parts of the sample space are contained in exactly one of the sets of our partition. The law of total probability is an indispensable tool for computing probabilities in practice.\n\nExample 4.6 (Sadie’s Possibly Late Package) Sadie has still not received the package that Charles had ordered. While it is not late yet, Charles decides to figure out the probability that the package will end up being late. Recall that company \\(A\\) is late \\(75\\%\\) of the time while company \\(B\\) is late \\(15\\%\\) of the time, and the store that Charles ordered from sends out \\(10\\%\\) of packages with company \\(A\\), and the rest with company \\(B\\), which is more likely.\nWhat is the probability that the package arrives late?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \\(A, B\\) forms a partition of the sample space as every package is either sent with \\(A\\) or with \\(B\\), and no package can be sent with both. Further, if \\(L\\) represents the event that the package is late, then we know that \\(P(L|A) = 0.75\\) and \\(P(L|B) = 0.15\\). Since \\(P(A) = 0.1\\) and \\(P(B) = 0.9\\), an application of the law of total probability gives \\[P(L) = P(L|A)P(A) + P(L|B)P(B) = (0.75)(0.1) + (0.15)(0.9) = 0.21.\\] As a result, knowing nothing else, the package has a probability of \\(0.21\\) of being late.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.7 (Charles’ Many Urns) While shopping at some garage sales one Sunday morning, Charles and Sadie stumble across a wonderful find! They see three urns which are exactly identical to the one that Charles had already purchased to store the different balls which turned out to not be balls at all. Realizing the opportunity they splurge and purchase them all, and then divide the various objects between the four urns, placing all the spheres in one container, all the cubes in another, all the pyramids in a third, and all the cones in a fourth.\nOnce done, they use a different selection mechanism. First, they pick an urn at random. Next, they randomly grab one of the items from within it. The distribution of colours and shapes is included in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColour\nSphere (Urn 1)\nCube (Urn 2)\nPyramid (Urn 3)\nCone (Urn 4)\n\n\n\n\nRed\n2\n3\n2\n0\n\n\nBlue\n1\n0\n0\n6\n\n\nGreen\n2\n2\n1\n2\n\n\nYellow\n0\n4\n2\n1\n\n\nBlack\n3\n1\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that they select any of the five colours under this sampling scheme?\nHow does this change if the probability that each urn is selected is proportional to the number of items in it? (Thus, urn 1 is selected with probability \\(8/35\\), and so forth).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(R\\), \\(B\\), \\(G\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Bk\\) be the events that a red, blue, green, yellow, or black ball are selected. Further, let \\(U_1\\), \\(U_2\\), \\(U_3\\), and \\(U_4\\) be the events that the first, second, third, or fourth urn are selected. Then note that, according to the law of total probability, \\[P(R) = P(R, U_1) + P(R, U_2) + P(R, U_3) + P(R, U_4) = \\sum_{j=1}^4 P(R|U_j)P(U_j).\\] An equivalent argument holds for each of the other colours. Now, \\[P(R|U_j) = \\dfrac{N_{R\\cap U_j}}{N_{U_j}},\\] where \\(N_{R\\cap U_j}\\) is the number of red objects in urn \\(j\\) and \\(N_{U_j}\\) is the total number in urn \\(j\\). Plugging this in and simplifying we get \\[P(R) = \\sum_{j=1}^4P(R|U_j)\\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right) = \\dfrac{1}{4}\\left\\{\\dfrac{2}{8} + \\dfrac{3}{10} + \\dfrac{2}{6}\\right\\} = \\dfrac{53}{240}.\\]\nWe can apply analogous arguments to the other colours giving \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(B) &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\\left\\{\\dfrac{1}{8} + \\dfrac{6}{11}\\right\\} = \\dfrac{59}{352} \\\\\nP(G) &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\\left\\{\\dfrac{2}{8} + \\dfrac{2}{10} + \\dfrac{1}{6} + \\dfrac{2}{11}\\right\\} = \\dfrac{527}{2640}\\\\\nP(Y) &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\\left\\{\\dfrac{4}{10} + \\dfrac{2}{6} + \\dfrac{1}{11}\\right\\} = \\dfrac{34}{165}\\\\\nP(Bk) &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\\left\\{\\dfrac{3}{8} + \\dfrac{1}{10} + \\dfrac{1}{6} + \\dfrac{2}{11}\\right\\} = \\dfrac{1087}{5280}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNote that these probabilities sum to \\(1\\). In decimal these simplify to approximately 0.221, 0.168, 0.2, 0.206, 0.206.\nUsing the same setup as before, we have \\[P(R) = P(R, U_1) + P(R, U_2) + P(R, U_3) + P(R, U_4) = \\sum_{j=1}^4 P(R|U_j)P(U_j).\\] Now \\(P(U_1) = 8/35\\), \\(P(U_2) = 10/35\\), \\(P(U_3) = 6/35\\), and \\(P(U_4) = 11/35\\). Moreover, the conditional probabilities themselves do not change, and so instead we have \\[P(R) = \\left\\{\\dfrac{2}{8}\\cdot\\dfrac{8}{35} + \\dfrac{3}{10}\\cdot\\dfrac{10}{35} + \\dfrac{2}{6}\\dfrac{6}{35} + \\dfrac{0}{11}\\cdot\\dfrac{11}{35}\\right\\} = \\dfrac{N_R}{35}.\\] Note that when multiplying by the marginal probability of the urn, the denominator will always cancel. As a result, we end up with the total number of reds over \\(35\\), which leads to \\(P(R) = \\dfrac{1}{5}\\). The same will be true for the other colours, and as a result, if we choose the urn based on a weighted selection, this will result in equal probability once more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Bayes’ Theorem\nWe have seen the direct computation of marginal probabilities (while using an equally likely outcome model), the computation of conditional probabilities, the use of the multiplication rule for joint probabilities, and the use of the law of total probability to indirectly calculate marginal probabilities through conditioning arguments. Throughout these discussions we have been primarily concerned with keeping events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) arbitrary. Everything that we have indicated for \\(P(A)\\) holds for \\(P(B)\\), as does \\(P(A|B)\\) and \\(P(B|A)\\). In reality, it will often be the case that conditioning on one of the events will be natural, while conditioning on the other will be more tricky. In these events, it can be useful to be able to transform statements regarding \\(P(A|B)\\) into statements regarding \\(P(B|A)\\), and vice versa.\nNote that because the definitions are symmetric, \\[P(A|B)P(B) = P(A,B) = P(B|A)P(A).\\] This is an application of the multiplication rule in two different orientations. If we divide both sides of the equality by \\(P(B)\\), assuming that it is not \\(0\\), then we get \\[P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}.\\] Now, if we form a partition, say \\(A,A_2,A_3,\\dots\\), then we can rewrite \\(P(B)\\) using the law of total probability as \\[P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A_2)P(A_2) + \\cdots = P(B|A)P(A) + \\sum_{i=2}P(B|A_i)P(A_i).\\] Taken together this gives a result known as Bayes’ Theorem.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem\n\n\n\nSuppose that there are two events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), with \\(P(B) &gt; 0\\). Moreover, suppose that \\(A\\) taken with \\(A_2, A_3, \\dots\\) forms a partition. Then Bayes’ Theorem states that \\[P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \\dfrac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + \\sum_{i=2} P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}.\\]\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem allows us to convert statements regarding \\(P(B|A)\\) into statements regarding \\(P(A|B)\\). Note that, as we derived above, Bayes’ Theorem is an application of the multiplication rule and an application of the law of total probability.5 Sometimes we may have \\(P(B)\\) directly, rendering the law of total probability in the denominator unnecessary.\nOften, the natural partition to select when we do need the law of total probability is to take \\(A\\) and \\(A^C\\). Note that any set with its complement forms a partition, since by definition they occupy the entire space and are non-overlapping. When this is done we get the slightly more compact relationship of \\[P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^C)P(A^C)}.\\]\nBayes’ Theorem differs from our previous relationships as it allows us to translate one set of conditional probabilities into another. Every other relationship we have looked at has moved between types of probabilities, whereas Bayes’ Theorem deals directly with conditional relationships.\nA commonly used example application for Bayes’ Theorem is medical testing. Suppose that we know the performance characteristics of a particular medical test: it is \\(99\\%\\) accurate for positive cases, and \\(95\\%\\) accurate for negative cases. That is, with probability \\(0.99\\) it correctly returns positive when an individual is infected, and with probability \\(0.95\\) it returns negative when an individual is not infected. These are both statements of conditional probability.\nIf we take \\(A\\) to be the event that the test returns positive, and \\(B\\) to be the event that the patient is infected,6 then we are saying that \\(P(A|B) = 0.99\\) and \\(P(A^C|B^C) = 0.95\\) which means that \\(P(A|B^C) = 0.05\\).7 Suppose that we know that, across the entire population, one in a thousand individuals is likely to be infected. This means that \\(P(B) = 0.001\\).\nNow if a random individual goes into a doctor’s office and tests positive for the disease, how likely are they to actually be infected? In this case we want to know the probability of them being infected given that they have tested positive. In notation, this is \\(P(B|A)\\). We do not know this quantity directly, but given an application of Bayes’ Theorem, we can find it. Using the natural partition of \\(B\\) and \\(B^C\\), we get \\[P(B|A) = \\dfrac{P(A|B)P(A)}{P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|B^C)P(B^C)} = \\dfrac{(0.99)(0.001)}{(0.99)(0.001)+(0.05)(0.999)} \\approx 0.019.\\] That is, despite the fact that this test is exceptionally effective at detecting this disease, a positive test still means that an individual has a probability of only \\(0.019\\) of actually having the illness.8\n\nExample 4.8 (Sadie’s Late Package) Sadie eventually received the package that Charles had sent, but it arrived very late. Sadie was not home when the package was delivered and there no obvious markings on the box to indicate which of the two delivery companies had sent it.\nGiven this information, and knowing that company \\(A\\) is late \\(75\\%\\) of the time while company \\(B\\) is late \\(15\\%\\) of the time, and the store that Charles ordered from sends out \\(10\\%\\) of packages with company \\(A\\), and the rest with company \\(B\\), what is the probability that the package was delivered by each of the two companies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to determine \\(P(A|L)\\) and \\(P(B|L)\\). We know that \\(P(L|A) = 0.75\\) and \\(P(L|B) = 0.15\\). Moreover, we know that \\(P(A) = 0.1\\) and \\(P(B) = 0.9\\). Applying Bayes’ Theorem directly we get \\[P(A|L) = \\dfrac{P(L|A)P(A)}{P(L|A)P(A) + P(L|B)P(B)} = \\dfrac{(0.75)(0.10)}{(0.75)(0.10) + (.10)(0.90)} = \\dfrac{5}{11}.\\] Similarly, we get \\[P(B|L) = \\dfrac{P(B|A)P(B)}{P(L|A)P(A) + P(L|B)P(B)} = \\dfrac{(0.15)(0.90)}{(0.75)(0.10) + (.10)(0.90)} = \\dfrac{6}{11}.\\] Note, we could have also used the fact that \\(P(A|L) + P(B|L) = 1\\) to determine this. As a result, it is more likely that \\(B\\) delivered the package than \\(A\\).9\n\n\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem highlights a key lesson when considering conditional probabilities, and it’s a common mistake to make which should be avoided at all costs. Namely, we cannot interchange \\(P(A|B)\\) with \\(P(B|A)\\). These probabilities are not necessarily highly correlated with one another, and it is important to distinguish clearly which is the probability of interest.10 The stakes of these types of confusion can be quite high, and it is tremendously important to ensure that you are conditioning on the correct events. Fortunately, Bayes’ Theorem allows us to translate between events for conditioning, giving a mechanism from translating between the two.11",

    "section": "4.4 Independence",
    "text": "4.4 Independence\nWe have seen that, in most cases, conditioning on an event changes the probability of that event. For instance, if we want to know the probability it is raining, if we condition on knowing that it is a day full of gray skies, the conditional probability is likely higher than the marginal probability. By considering how the marginal and conditional probabilities differ, we are in effect indicating a dependence of the events on one another. In terms of probability, this dependence is captured by an influence on the degree of uncertainty present depending on what we know.\nIt is totally possible that two events do not influence one another at all. The weather outside today is likely not influenced by your favourite sports team’s performance last night.12 In this case, we would have \\(P(A|B) = P(A)\\).\nWe saw an example of this previously when we wanted to know the probability of a randomly selected card being a heart (\\(A\\)) given that it was an ace (\\(B\\)). We found that this was \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\), exactly the same as the probability if we did not know that it was an ace. Thus here we have \\(P(A|B)=P(A)\\). We could have also said that \\(P(B|A)=P(B)=\\dfrac{1}{13}\\). The symmetry of these events makes it somewhat more convenient to express this relationship differently.\nInstead of writing \\(P(A|B) = P(A)\\) and \\(P(B|A) = P(B)\\), we can multiply the first relationship by \\(P(B)\\) on both sides, or the second by \\(P(A)\\) on both sides. The multiplication rule gives \\(P(A|B)P(B) = P(A,B)\\), and so the first relationship becomes \\(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\\). The second follows exactly the same. Any two events that satisfy this relationship are said to be independent.\n\nDefinition 4.5 (Independence) Any two events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which satisfy \\(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\\) are said to be independent. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent we write \\(A\\perp B\\), and read “\\(A\\) is independent of \\(B\\)”. Any events which are not independent are said to be dependent, and we write \\(A\\not\\perp B\\).\n\nNote that independence is always a symmetric property: if \\(A\\) is independent of \\(B\\), then \\(B\\) is independent of \\(A\\). To check whether two events are independent, we check whether their joint probability is equal to the product of their marginal probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of Independence\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if \\(A\\perp B\\), then \\(A^C\\perp B\\), \\(A^C\\perp B^C\\), and vice versa. To see this note \\[P(A^C, B) + P(A, B) = P(B),\\] by the Law of Total Probability. Then, by independence of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) this gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(A^C, B) + P(A)P(B) &= P(B) \\\\\n\\implies P(A^C, B) &= P(B) - P(A)P(B) \\\\\n&= P(B)(1 - P(A)) \\\\\n&= P(B)P(A^C),\\end{align*}\\] as is required. The other combinations follow in the same manner.\n\n\n\nIf \\(P(A)\\neq 0\\), then we can divide both sides by \\(P(A)\\) to gives \\(P(B|A) = P(B)\\). Similarly, if \\(P(B)\\neq 0\\), then we can divide both sides by \\(P(B)\\) to give \\(P(A|B)=P(A)\\). This expression in terms of conditional probabilities is the more intuitive expression of independence. It directly captures the idea that “knowing \\(B\\) does not change our belief about \\(A\\)”. However, we must be careful. This conditional argument is only valid when the event that is being conditioned on is not probability \\(0\\), where the defining relationship, \\(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\\), will hold for all events. Recall that, in general, \\[P(A\\cap B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cup B).\\] It is only when assuming independence that this simplifies further.\n\nRemark (The Multiplication and Addition Rules of Probability). Often, in elementary probability and statistics courses, the Multiplication Rule and the Addition Rule for calculating probabilities are emphasized and named. It is emphasized that to calculate probabilities, we will often multiply together other probabilities, or else add a sequence of them. These rules often form the backbone of probability computation. At this point, we have now seen both the typical Multiplication Rule and the typical Addition Rule, without drawing specific attention to them as such.\nThe multiplication rule states that, for independent events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(P(A\\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\\). That is, with independent events if you want to know the probability that they both happen, you multiply together the probabilities. The addition rule states that, for disjoint events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\\). That is, with disjoint events if you want to know the probability that either or occurs, you add them together. These can be quite handy tools when correctly applied.\nFor instance, if we assume that we flip a coin then roll a die, we can say that the probability that you get a heads and an even number must be \\(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\times\\dfrac{1}{2} = \\dfrac{1}{4}\\) since \\(P(\\text{Heads}) = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\) and \\(P(\\text{Even}) = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\), and the coin flip must be independent of the die roll. Similarly, suppose that we wish to know what the probability that, when drawing a card from a standard deck of \\(52\\) cards, the result is an Ace, Three, Six, or King. Here we can say that this must be \\(\\dfrac{4}{52} + \\dfrac{4}{52} + \\dfrac{4}{52} + \\dfrac{4}{52} = \\dfrac{4}{13}\\). This is because each rank has a \\(\\dfrac{4}{52}\\) chance of occurring, and each of these events are disjoint.\nSo, if the multiplication and addition rules are handy, why do we not discuss them directly in these notes? As pointed out, we did learn both of the rules: the multiplication rule is the defining relationship for independent events, and the addition rule is the axiom of additivity. However, highlighting these as substantially more important than the surrounding topics can lead to deeper struggles with probability calculations. Specifically, these two techniques apply in only very limited situations: if we know that events are independent or we know that events are disjoint. Most of the time, neither assumption is going to hold, and in those settings we need to move past multiplying or adding to critically thinking about the specific quantities. This can lead to deeper confusion in translating these beyond simple examples.\nThe concern here moves beyond ensuring success in introductory sequences of probability and statistics. Uncritical deference to the multiplication and addition rules can have dire real-world consequences. As one particularly sobering example, Sally Clark was convicted in 1999 of the murder of her two sons, each of whom had died a few weeks following their birth. The defense claimed that the deaths were the results of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The prosecution presented a statistical analysis from a paediatrician, Roy Meadow, who claimed that the probability of an infant dying of SIDS is approximately \\(\\dfrac{1}{8500}\\). An application of the multiplication rule then tells us that the probability that both of Sally Clark’s sons would die of SIDS is \\[\\dfrac{1}{8500}\\times\\dfrac{1}{8500} = \\dfrac{1}{72,250,000}.\\] This is very rare, and seemed strong enough evidence to convict Sally Clark. The conviction was later overturned on an appeal, owing to both additional evidence coming to light and a critique of the statistical reasoning employed in the case published by the Royal Society of Statistics, but only after Sally Clark had served more than three years of a prison sentence.\nThe stakes of these types of calculations can be tremendously high, and it is critically important to not rely on simplified rules when working with probabilities and statistics. As individuals armed with the tools of probability and statistics it is imperative that we remain responsible with our application of these techniques; there is an air of authority that is carried by quantitative statements, and when misplaced, the consequences can be dire.\n\n\nExample 4.9 (Independence and Board Games) Charles and Sadie are invited over by their friend, Garth, to play some board games. Both of them are quite excited by this prospect! Board games feel like the next logical step for the two of them to highlight their love of both probability and games! Garth has a large board game collection, and begins to explain the games to Charles and Sadie across a variety of axes:\n\nWhether the games are competitive or cooperative.\nHow many players the games play best at (\\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4+\\}\\)).\nHow “heavy” the games tend to be (friendly for everyone, moderately involved, or very heavy).\n\nWhile Garth continues on about several other topics including the themes, the mechanics, or the rating on BoardGameGeek, Charles drifts off wondering whether the traits listed are independent in Garth’s collection. Suppose that Garth has \\(100\\) games, of which:\n\n\\(25\\) are cooperative.\n\\(5\\) are best played at one player, \\(20\\) at two, and \\(55\\) at three.\n\\(10\\) are friendly for everyone and \\(45\\) are moderately involved.\n\n\nIf \\(5\\) games are best played at two players and are cooperative, are these events independent?\nIf \\(20\\) games are heavy and best played with \\(4+\\) players, are these events independent?\nIf \\(0\\) games are both moderately involved and cooperative, are these events independent?\nCharles figures that competitive games and two player games are independent. How many competitive two player games are there?\nIs it possible that competitive games are independent of heavy games?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are suggesting that \\(P(A,B) = 0.05\\), where \\(A\\) is “two player” and \\(B\\) is “cooperative”. We know that \\(P(B) = 0.25\\) and \\(P(A) = 0.20\\). Calculating \\(P(A)P(B) = (0.20)(0.25) = 0.05 = P(A,B)\\), and so these traits are independent.\nWe have \\(P(A,B) = 0.2\\) where \\(A\\) is “heavy” and \\(B\\) is “\\(4+\\) players. We know that \\(P(A) = 0.45\\) and \\(P(B) = 0.20\\), and so \\(P(A)P(B) = (0.45)(0.20) = 0.09 \\neq P(A,B)\\). As a result, these traits are not independent.\nWe know that \\(P(A) &gt; 0\\) and \\(P(B) &gt; 0\\) for \\(A\\) being moderately involved and \\(B\\) being cooperative. As a result, \\(P(A)P(B) &gt; 0\\), and so if \\(P(A,B) = 0\\), they must not be independent.\nTaking \\(A\\) to be “competitive” we have \\(P(A) = 0.75\\). Taking \\(B\\) to be “two player” we have \\(P(B) = 0.20\\). As a result, if \\(A\\perp B\\) then \\(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B) = (0.75)(0.20) = 0.15\\). Thus, there must be \\(15\\) competitive, two player games.\nTaking \\(A\\) to be “competitive” we have \\(P(A) = 0.75\\). Taking \\(B\\) to be “heavy” weh ave \\(P(B) = 0.45\\). Thus, if they were independent, we would have \\(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B) = (0.75)(0.45) = 0.3375\\). This would require \\(33.75\\) games to be heavy, competitive games and so we must conclude that they are not independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.0.1 Mutually Exclusive Events\nImportantly, if \\(A\\perp B\\), then \\(A\\cap B\\neq \\emptyset\\) unless at least one of \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) equals \\(\\emptyset\\) or \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). To see this recall that \\(P(\\emptyset) = 0\\), and so if \\(A\\cap B = \\emptyset\\) then \\(P(A\\cap B) = P(A)P(B) = P(\\emptyset) = 0\\). Moreover, \\(P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1\\) and \\(\\mathcal{S} \\cap B = B\\), so \\(P(\\mathcal{S} \\cap B) = 1P(B) = P(B)\\). This only holds if either probability is \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). This may seem to be a rather technical point, however, it is the source of much confusion regarding independence. In particular, it is common to mistake independent events for mutually exclusive events.\n\nDefinition 4.6 (Mutually Exclusive Events) Two events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are said to be mutually exclusive if they are disjoint. In particular, if \\(P(A,B) = 0\\) then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive events, with \\(P(A) &gt; 0\\) and \\(P(B) &gt; 0\\), then \\(A\\not\\perp B\\).\n\nWhenever only one event from a set of events can happen, we refer to the events as being mutually exclusive. If one happens, we know that the others did not. Mutually exclusive events, with positive probability, are always dependent since knowing that \\(A\\) occurs dramatically shifts our belief about \\(B\\),\\(C\\), and \\(D\\).13\nThe primary concern with mutually exclusive and independent events is a linguistic one. We often use words like independent to mean unrelated, and in a sense, mutually exclusive events are unrelated in that one has nothing to do with another. However, in statistics and probability, when we discuss independence, it is not an independence of the events themselves but rather an independence relating to our beliefs regarding the uncertainty associated with the events. In this sense, mutually exclusive events are very informative regarding the uncertainty associated with them.\n\nExample 4.10 (Charles and Sadie Cooking Dinner) Suppose that Charles and Sadie always eat dinner together. It will either be the case that Charles cooks at home, that Sadie cooks at home, that the two of them order in, or that they go out to eat. If we take these to be four events, \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\), then are any of these events independent? Mutually exclusive? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming, as it seems reasonable given the information in the question, that only one of the possible tasks occurs for dinner in a night, then we know that \\[P(A,B) = P(A,C) = P(A,D) = P(B,C) = P(B,D) = P(C,D) = 0.\\] As a result, all of the events described are mutually exclusive, and correspondingly, are not independent.",

    "text": "4.5 Contingency Tables\nThrough to this point we have discussed probabilities in the abstract, either through an enumeration of equally likely outcomes, or else by directly specifying the likelihood of various events. While these are useful in many regards, we are often looking for more concise manners of summarizing information of interest. One tool for accomplishing this is a contingency table.\n\nDefinition 4.7 (Contingency Table) A contingency table is a tabular summary of information which summarizes the joint probabilities of two or more variables. Typically a contingency table will take one factor for the columns and a secondary factor for the rows, where each cell then represents the frequency with which observations occur in the two corresponding categories simultaneously.\n\nTo begin, you could imagine constructing a frequency table relaying the frequency with which undergraduate students are enrolled in various faculties at a particular university. This tells you, of the whole population of students at the university, what is the faculty breakdown. By dividing the number in each faculty by the total number of students, you convert the frequencies to proportions, and these proportions can be viewed as probabilities. (See Table 4.1.14) The interpretation of proportions as probabilities implies a very specific statistical experiment. In particular, the proportion represents the probability that an individual selected at random from the entire population has the given trait. This is frequently a probability of interest, which makes these summary tables a useful tool.15\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Frequency and corresponding proportions of enrolment by faculty in a university.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\nEnrolment\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nArts\n1266\n0.2182382\n\n\nComputer Science\n749\n0.1291157\n\n\nEducation\n786\n0.1354939\n\n\nEngineering\n1315\n0.2266851\n\n\nLaw\n266\n0.0458542\n\n\nNursing\n543\n0.0936046\n\n\nScience\n876\n0.1510084\n\n\nTotal\n5801\n1.0000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a single trait is displayed we refer to these tabular summaries as frequency tables or frequency distributions. A contingency table instead plots two or more traits on the same table, with each cell representing the frequency of both traits occurring simultaneously in the population. Extending the university example, we may further include the student’s current year of study to see the breakdown of both faculty and year of study, in one table.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Frequency of enrolment by faculty and year of study in a university.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nYear 4\nYear 5+\n\n\n\n\n\nArts\n222\n276\n273\n225\n270\n1266\n\n\nComp.

Being able to concisely summarize all of these concepts regarding traits in a population of interest renders contingency tables immensely useful in the study of uncertainty broadly.\nConsider the two-way contingency table, Table 4.2. Each cell consists of frequency with which a combination of the two traits occurs in the population.16 If we take events corresponding to each of the levels of the two variables of interest, then these central cells represent the frequency of joint events. That is, each interior cell gives the total number of observations with a set level for variable one17 AND a set level for variable two18. For instance, there are 50 individuals who are in Law and studying in Year 2.\nEach row is then summed, with the total number following into the corresponding row recorded in the right hand margin. each column is summed, with the total number corresponding to the given column recorded in the bottom margin. For instance there are a total of 786 students in Education and a total of 1393 in Year 3. Then the margin totals are summed and the total is recorded in the lower right margin space (in this case, 5801). Whether the rows or columns are summed, they should sum to the same total, which is the total of the population under consideration. This is the same as simply adding all of the observed interior frequencies. To turn a frequency into a probability, you need only divide the correct frequency by the correct total.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Proportions of enrolment by faculty and year of study in a university.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nYear 4\nYear 5+\n\n\n\n\n\nArts\n0.0382693\n0.0475780\n0.0470609\n0.0387864\n0.0465437\n0.2182382\n\n\nComp.

Here we are saying that some fixed number, \\(m\\), of the \\(N\\) total individuals have both traits under consideration. For instance, the joint probability that a student is in Law and studying in Year 2 is 0.0086192.19 If instead you wish to find a marginal probability, you have to consider the value in the corresponding margin: this is the total number of individuals with the given trait, ignoring the level of the other variable. These marginal values are also divided by the total population size. For instance, there is a 0.1354939 probability of observing a student in Education and a probability 0.240131 of observing a student in Year 3.\nOutside of joint and marginal probabilities, we can also find conditional probabilities. To do so, we restrict our focus to either only one row, or one column. Then, we can take the joint cell and divide by the value in the margin, which gives the conditional probability of interest. Note, this works with either the contingency table directly or with the propensity table. The reasoning is that the propensity table divided by the same totals in the numerator and the denominator. Suppose we take some cell, \\(A\\cap B\\), which has \\(N_{A, B}\\) in the contingency table. Then, \\[P(A\\cap B) = \\dfrac{N_{A, B}}{N} \\quad\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\quad P(B) = \\dfrac{N_B}{N}.\\] If we consider then forming \\(P(A|B)\\) we get \\[P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\dfrac{N_{A \\cap B}/\\cancel{N}}{N_B/\\cancel{N}} = \\dfrac{N_{A, B}}{N_B}.\\] Thus, given that we know a student is in Education, then the probability that they are in Year 3 is approximately 0.2341.\nNote that these procedures are exactly in line with what we had seen before. The conditional probability is defined as the joint probability divided by the marginal probability. The process of computing the marginal can be seen as an application of the law of total probability. As a result, contingency tables can be a useful, tangible tool for investigating the techniques we have been discussing: they are not a substitute for direct manipulation of the mathematical objects, but they can present insight into the underlying processes where it may be hard to derive that insight otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Law of Total Probability: Contingency Table’s Version\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the law of total probability states that, if \\(B_1,\\dots,B_n\\) forms a partition of the sample space, then \\[P(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A|B_i)P(B_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A, B_i)\\]. In a contingency table it is easier to see how either of the two factors at play (either those in the rows or the columns) forms a partition of the space. Every observation has to fall in exactly one row and exactly one column. Thus, if we want to know the marginal frequency of a single trait (say represented by some row of the table), then one way to find this total is to sum up every observation in each of the corresponding columns. This is precisely the same process as the law of total probability. Note that, denoting each column as \\(B_i\\), and supposing there are \\(k\\) total columns, then the total number in a row is taken to be \\[N_A = \\sum_{i=1}^k N_{A, B_i},\\] simply as the summation of the corresponding row. By definition, \\(P(A) = \\dfrac{N_A}{N}\\), and so dividing both sides by \\(N\\) gives \\[P(A) = \\dfrac{N_A}{N} = \\dfrac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^k N_{A, B_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\dfrac{N_{A, B_i}}{N} = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A\\cap B_i).\\]\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that there is redundant information within a contingency table. For instance, the margins need not be listed explicitly, as they can be directly calculated from the interior points. Same goes for interior points, given the margins of the table (assuming some interior points are also presented). This can be useful for a compact representation of the information, and manipulating these tables – being able to find the required information in many places – should become familiar to you as you continue to work with them more and more.\n\nExample 4.11 (The Evolving Contents of Charle’s Urns) After learning of contingency tables, Sadie points out to Charles that with the whole urn debacle they went through, the two of them actually ended up using a contingency table to summarize the information. How neat! In the interim, there has been some development in the contents of Charles’s urns, and armed with the new knowledge of contingency tables, the following summary is produced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCone\nCube\nPyramid\nSphere\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n2\nA\n1\n3\n10\n\n\nBlue\n1\n2\n1\n1\n5\n\n\nGreen\n3\n3\nB\n5\n15\n\n\nRed\n2\nC\n3\n2\nD\n\n\nYellow\n5\n3\n4\n1\n13\n\n\n\n13\nE\n13\n12\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSadly, Charles does not have the best writing and Sadie cannot make out what values were written in for the cells marked \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), and \\(E\\).\n\nWhat are the values for the missing values?\nWhat is the probability that a black cube is drawn?\nWhat is the probability that a red object is drawn?\nWhat is the probability that a cube is drawn?\nGiven that the drawn object was a pyramid, what is the probability that it is green?\nGiven that the object is green, what is the probability that it is a pyramid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe start by filling in the missing cells, in order.\n\nFor \\(A\\) we can note that \\(2 + A + 1 + 3 = 10\\), which gives that \\(A = 4\\). We could have also tried a column sum, however, this would involve \\(3\\) unknowns and so would not have given a numeric result.\nFor \\(B\\) either a row sum or column sum would produce the correct answer. We either take \\(3 + 3 + B + 5 = 15\\) giving \\(B = 4\\) or \\(1 + 1 + B + 3 + 4 = 13\\) giving \\(B=4\\).\n\\(C\\) is more challenging as we either have that \\(2 + C + 3 + 2 = D\\) or \\(4 + 2 + 3 + C + 3 = E\\)20 As a result, for this technique we will need to find either \\(D\\) or \\(E\\) first. There is an alternative technique to use, which would be to note that we have all the internal points specified at this point, and we know that these sum to \\(50\\). As a result, we could note that \\(C = 50 - 10 - 5 - 15 - 13 - 2 - 3 - 2 = 0\\) or that \\(C =  50 - 13 - 13 - 12 - 4 - 2 - 3 - 3 = 0\\).\nWe can find \\(D\\) either by subtracting from the total, \\(D = 50 - 10 - 5 - 15 - 13 = 7\\), or by adding along the row, \\(2 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 7\\).21 Note that with \\(D = 7\\), had we not found \\(C = 0\\) above, we could now take \\(2 + C + 3 + 2 = 7\\) and find \\(C = 0\\).\nLike \\(D\\), we have two options for working this out. Either \\(E = 50 - 13 - 13 - 12 = 12\\) or \\(E = 4 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 3 = 12\\).22 Like with \\(D\\), had we solved for \\(E\\) first, then we could find \\(C\\) via \\(4 + 2 + 3 + C + 3 = 12\\).\n\nHere we want \\(P(\\text{Black}, \\text{Cube})\\). This is given by the frequency of black cubes divided by \\(50\\). Thus, \\[P(\\text{Black}, \\text{Cube}) = \\dfrac{A}{50} = \\dfrac{4}{50} = 0.08.\\]\nHere we want \\(P(\\text{Red})\\). This is given by the marginal frequency of red objects divided by \\(50\\). Thus, \\[P(\\text{Red}) = \\dfrac{D}{50} = \\dfrac{7}{50} = 0.14.\\]\nHere we want \\(P(\\text{Cube})\\). This is given by the marginal frequency of cubes divided by \\(50\\). Thus, \\[P(\\text{Cube}) = \\dfrac{E}{50} = \\dfrac{12}{50} = 0.24.\\]\nHere we want \\(P(\\text{Green}|\\text{Pyramid})\\). This is given by the frequency of green pyramids divided by the marginal frequency of pyramids. Thus \\[P(\\text{Green}|\\text{Pyramid}) = \\dfrac{B}{13} = \\dfrac{4}{13} \\approx 0.308.\\]\nHere we want \\(P(\\text{Pyramid}|\\text{Green})\\). This is given by the frequency of green pyramids divided by the marginal frequency of green objects.23 Thus \\[P(\\text{Pyramid}|\\text{Green}) = \\dfrac{B}{15} = \\dfrac{4}{15} \\approx 0.267.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also important to recognize that independence and mutually exclusive events can be codified via the table as well. Zeros on the interior points indicate events which are mutually exclusive: if we know that one of them occurred, we also know that the other one did not. For independence, it requires a degree of solving proportions. We can either check that the joint probability (\\(N_{A,B}/N\\)) is equal to the product of the two marginal probabilities, (\\(N_AN_B/N^2\\)), or else (assuming that the events are all non-zero), that the conditional probability (\\(N_{A,B}/N_A\\)) equals the marginal probability \\(N_B/N\\). Either way this is represented by \\(N\\times N_{A,B} = N_AN_B\\), and when this holds, we can conclude that the events are independent.\n\nExample 4.12 (Independent or Mutually Exclusive Urn Shapes) After helping Charles neatly fill in the contingency table, Sadie begins to wonder about whether there are any shape-colour combinations which are independent, or if any are mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCone\nCube\nPyramid\nSphere\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n2\n4\n1\n3\n10\n\n\nBlue\n1\n2\n1\n1\n5\n\n\nGreen\n3\n3\n4\n5\n15\n\n\nRed\n2\n0\n3\n2\n7\n\n\nYellow\n5\n3\n4\n1\n13\n\n\n\n13\n12\n13\n12\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any events represented in the contingency table which are mutually exclusive?\nAre there any events represented in the contingency table which are independent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutually exclusive events are codified via a \\(0\\) frequency. We can see then that \\(\\text{Cube}\\) and \\(\\text{Red}\\) are mutually exclusive. That is, if we know that an object is red, we also know that it is not a cube. And if we know that an object is a cube, then we know that it is not red.\nIndependence is more cumbersome to check. We require the product of marginal counts to be equal to the total times by the joint counts. As a result, the easiest way to check is to consider the product of each marginal value in the columns by each marginal value in the row, divided by \\(50\\). If this value corresponds to the value in that row/column pairing, then we know that those features are independent. Note that immediately we can rule out any products which are not divisible by \\(50\\), since we know that \\(N_{A,B}\\) is an integer for all \\(A,B\\) and \\(N_{A,B} = N_AN_B/50\\) if there is independence. To this end, we only need to check the product of each of the row totals with each of \\(12\\) and \\(13\\) (as those are the only two unique column totals). This gives, in order \\(120\\), \\(130\\), \\(60\\), \\(65\\), \\(180\\), \\(195\\), \\(84\\), \\(91\\), \\(156\\), and \\(169\\). None of these values are divisible by \\(50\\) and as a result we know that there is no independence codified in this table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.0.1 Contingency Tables and Data Frames in R\nIn R we can use the table and prop.table to calculate the (interior) of a contingency table. This will return a table type object in R, which can be thought of as a matrix of sorts. On it, we can use the functions rowSums and colSums to get the summation of the rows and columns, respectively. Typically the object we pass to table will be a data frame. A data frame is another R object type that we have not yet seen. The idea with a data frame is that we have multiple columns with different variables (of possibly different types) represented. Each row corresponds to a single observation, and then each column is read as a feature of those observations. Data frames are essentially large spreadsheets (or data tables) which indicate the various observations that we have. In practice, data frames are the most commonly used object in an R analysis, and we will see them plenty going forward.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWith a data frame specified, we can then use the table function called on it to form a contingency table.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThen, to get the totals, we can either use rowSums or colSums to return a vector with the corresponding row or column sums.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFinally, we can take our formed contingency table, and use prop.table on it, in order to return a table with the proportions (rather than the frequencies).\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "Note, this is another result which seems to (on the surface) defy expectations. We will see this again later on in this chapter in a slightly different context. It seems strange that company \\(A\\) is more likely to be late, and yet, we are more likely to see a late package that is sent by company \\(B\\) then a late package that is sent by company \\(A\\). The reason for this is that company \\(B\\) is used much more frequently than company \\(A\\), which overcomes the added likelihood of company \\(A\\) being late.↩︎\nFor instance, \\(5\\) is neither a multiple of \\(2\\) nor of \\(3\\).↩︎\nFor instance, \\(6\\) is a multiple of both \\(2\\) and \\(3\\).↩︎\nBayes’ Theorem is named in the same way that the Bayesian interpretation of probability is, and that Bayesian statistics is more broadly. The connections are more than merely surface: Bayes’ Theorem can be viewed as the primary technique with which we can update subjective beliefs about the world. Importantly, however, even those who use a Frequentist view of statistics accept the math of Bayes’ Theorem, and use it frequently.↩︎\nIn fact, I would go as far as to suggest that learning Bayes’ Theorem by itself is less important than fully grasping the definition of conditional probability alongside the multiplication rule and the law of total probability. I myself do not remember Bayes’ Theorem directly, but can write it down directly from these definitions without any thought.↩︎\nIt is worth drawing attention to the language that we have started to use at this point in the notes regarding “events”. In this case our sample space would actually be formed using pairs of information. In particular, we might have \\[\\mathcal{S} = \\{(\\text{Pos. Test}, \\text{Illness}), (\\text{Neg. Test}, \\text{Illness}),(\\text{Pos. Test}, \\text{No Illness}),(\\text{Neg. Test}, \\text{No Illness})\\}.\\] Then the event \\(A\\) here is actually \\(A = \\{(\\text{Pos. Test}, \\text{Illness}),(\\text{Pos. Test}, \\text{No Illness})\\}\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(\\{(\\text{Pos. Test}, \\text{Illness}),(\\text{Neg. Test}, \\text{Illness})\\}\\). It is far more clunky to make explicit these events, and so we move towards using more natural language. Until you feel confident that you can identify the specific outcomes associated with the events of interest, it is worth writing these out in full.↩︎\nSince \\(P(A|B^C) = 1 - P(A^C|B^C) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05\\).↩︎\nThis counter intuitive fact was an intensely frustrating reality for statisticians everywhere during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when politicians and the population at large turned away from testing owing to its perceived “ineffectiveness”. The quantity of interest for knowing how good a test is is \\(P(A|B)\\) and \\(P(A^C|B^C)\\). However, if a disease is sufficiently rare, with \\(P(B)\\) sufficiently small, then no matter how effective the tests are you will likely have \\(P(B|A)\\) to be low. Note that \\(P(B|A) &gt;&gt; P(B)\\) in the example, and this will also be true in general. A single test cannot say with certainty, however, they are an incredibly effective tool at reducing our uncertainty.↩︎\nNote that this is another example of a counterintuitive result. Here, \\(A\\) is far more likely to be late, but it is more likely that \\(B\\) delivered a late package to us than \\(A\\) because of the base rates. That is, \\(P(B)\\) is much higher to begin than \\(P(A)\\), and so that is hard to overcome. It is worth noting, however, that originally \\(P(B)\\) is \\(9\\) times more likely than \\(P(A)\\), and after knowing that package is late it is \\(\\dfrac{6}{5} = 1.2\\) times more likely. This major reduction in the relative likelihood is owed to how much more likely \\(A\\) is to deliver late packages than \\(B\\).↩︎\nMixing up \\(P(B|A)\\) and \\(P(A|B)\\) is often called confusion of the inverse, and it can lead to very faulty conclusions when ignored. In the medical testing example above, it is important to not confuse “the probability that the test returns positive, assuming you have the illness” with “the probability that you have the illness, given that the test returns positive.” This type of faulty logic has long been used to justify discriminatory behaviour in medicine, the law, and so on. A thorough understanding of statistics and probability helps to ensure that these types of errors are not made, and gives you the tools to push-back on the spots where people are making these arguments incorrectly, particularly when the stakes are high or harm is being done.↩︎\nWhen discussing Bayes’ Theorem we introduced two frequently occurring sources of error when reasoning about probabilities, and showed how to remedy them. Confusion of the inverse occurs when you mix up \\(P(A|B)\\) with \\(P(B|A)\\), and can lead to disastrous consequences. The base rate fallacy occurs when you fail to take into account the rareness of the marginal events and instead only consider the conditionals (such as seeing that delivery company \\(A\\) was more likely to be late than \\(B\\), without considering that \\(B\\) was more likely to be used than \\(A\\)). These are both examples of the challenges at the heart of probability and statistics: namely, the subjects are fairly unintuitive once moving beyond the basics. As a result, we need to rely on building up our intuitions over time by making use of the formal rules that we are able to derive.↩︎\nThough, perhaps the world will freeze over if (insert-your-least-favourite-team-here) wins the (insert-the-name-of-the-championship-for-the-league-you-care-about-here)?↩︎\nNamely, we know that all of the others are then impossible.↩︎\nNote, the values in this table are roughly inspired by a subset of the Fall 2022 University of New Brunswick Enrolment Numbers.↩︎\nThis provides further emphasis for the utility of urn models. If you imagine an urn that has balls with two or more traits (say like those in Example 4.3), then randomly selecting a single ball from this population has an analogous probability distribution.↩︎\nThat is, the number of students who are enrolled in that faculty, in that year of study.↩︎\nFaculty.↩︎\nYear of study.↩︎\nIt is worth reemphasizing what this probability actually means. If we were to randomly sample, with equal probability, individuals from this population then the probability that an individual selected has both the faculty and year specified is given by the joint probability. That is to say, if we did this over and over and over again (with replacement) in the long-term, these probabilities represent proportion of time those combinations would be observed.↩︎\nNote here, \\(A=4\\) has been filled in.↩︎\nWe have filled in \\(C = 0\\) here.↩︎\nThis uses \\(A=4\\) and \\(C=0\\).↩︎\nNote, we could also apply Bayes’ Theorem to find the result here. We know that \\(P(\\text{Green}|\\text{Pyramid}) = 4/13\\), that \\(P(\\text{Green}) = 15/50\\) and that \\(P(\\text{Pyramid}) = 13/50\\). Thus, Bayes’ Theorem gives \\[P(\\text{Pyramid}|\\text{Green}) = \\dfrac{(4/13)(13/50)}{15/50} = \\dfrac{4}{15},\\] exactly as in the direct derivation.↩︎",

    "text": "5.1 The Need for Random Variables\nWhen introducing probability originally we worked from a sample space and then corresponding events. This is a very general framework which allows us to effectively analyze any statistical experiment. Sample spaces are not restricted to be numeric, for instance, and events are simply subsets of the sample space. As a result, this framework provides the tools for capturing uncertainty quantification in almost any setting. Still, the need to enumerate sample spaces and events over complex sets of arbitrary items is cumbersome and may prevent succinct representations of the underlying phenomena. Often, rather than caring about the entire space of outcomes from an experiment of interest, we are primarily concerned we a summary of the experiment. When we can summarize the experiment using a numerical quantity, we are able to define a random variable.\nBy reporting the numeric value of the random variable, we are able to summarize the key part of the experiment, succinctly.\nFor instance, suppose that we are repeatedly tossing a coin. If we toss the coin \\(100\\) times, then the sample space is going to consist of \\(2^{100}\\) total possible outcomes, each of which is a sequence of \\(100\\) heads and tails.1 Instead, it may be more convenient to assign a random variable to be the number of heads that show up on the \\(100\\) tosses of the coin. In this case, the random variable takes on a non-negative integer between \\(0\\) and \\(100\\). In many situations, such a summary may be all the is relevant from the experiment.\nIt is important to recognize that information is lost when we define this random variable. If \\(X\\) summarizes the number of heads in \\(100\\) tosses of a coin, then provided \\(X\\) you are not able to answer the question “what was the 23rd toss of the coin?” As a result, random variables smooth over the unnecessary information, summarizing the parts of the statistical experiment that we care for. For any statistical experiment, however, we need to carefully define the random variables which are truly of interest to us.\nFor instance, if the \\(23\\)rd toss of the coin was integral to our decision-making, then perhaps we define a random variable \\(Y\\) which counts the number of heads that show up on the \\(100\\) tosses of the coin, but does so with negative numbers if the \\(23\\)rd toss was a tail, and with positive numbers if it was a head. Then, provided \\(Y\\) you can answer “how many heads showed up in the tosses of the coin? by calculating \\(|Y|\\), and you can answer”what was the \\(23\\)rd toss of the coin?” by looking at \\(\\text{sign}(Y)\\).\nBecause of their ability to summarize effectively and flexibly the pertinent components of a statistical experiment, random variables are the default paradigm for discussing randomness. When discussing a random variable we will typically use capital letters, such as \\(X\\), to represent the random quantity with an unknown value. In the event that an experiment is actually performed, and a value is realized for the random variable, we will record this value as a lower case letter, such as \\(x\\). For instance, the number of heads showing in \\(100\\) flips of a coin is an unknown quantity depending on chance which we call \\(X\\). Once we have flipped the coin \\(100\\) times and observed \\(57\\) heads, we denote this as \\(x=57\\).\nThe importance of this notation is merely to emphasize what values are unknown and random, and what values are known numeric quantities. Because \\(x\\) is a known value taking on some set number we will not often speak of probabilities involving \\(x\\).2 Instead, we wish to translate the language of probability that we have built to statements regarding the random variable \\(X\\).\nThe random variable \\(X\\) has a corresponding “sample space” of possible values that it can take on. We will typically refer to this as the support of the random variable, though borrowing other terms from math courses (such as range) will work also. This support, which we can think of as directly analogous to the sample space of arbitrary elements from before, will depend on the possible realizations from the underlying experiment. We typically will denote the support of a random variable \\(X\\) as \\(\\mathcal{X}\\). After the experiment has been performed the random variable will take on a single value from this set.3 We can sometimes compactly describe the set of possible values for a random variable, for instance, by stating all of the integers, or integers between \\(5\\) and \\(10\\), or even values less than \\(1000\\). This allows for compact descriptions of \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) even when the set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is challenging to describe. The probability of realizing any outcome in \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) is dictated by the underlying probability model.\nWhen introducing the concepts of probability we indicated that probability was assigned to events. With random variables, this remains true. As a result we need to define events in terms of random variables. When we have a random variable, \\(X\\), an event is defined as any set of values that it can take on. For instance, we may have the event \\(X=4\\), or the event \\(X \\geq 18\\), or the event \\(2 \\leq X \\leq 93\\), or the event \\(X \\in \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}\\). In each case these are subsets of the possible values that the random variable can take on, based on the outcome of the experiment.4\nJust as before these events can be simple events (comprised of a single outcome) or compound events (comprising of multiple outcomes). The event \\(\\{X=5\\}\\) is a simple event, whereas the event \\(\\{X \\geq 25\\}\\) is a compound event. With events defined in this way, we can translate the other concepts from the explicit event-based probability. Specifically, we think of the experiment producing a numerical outcome, and then use the same sets of tools as before applied to numeric events.\nWhen considering random variables there is a key distinction between two types of random variables, discrete and continuous.\nTypically, discrete random variables will take on some collection of the integers, where continuous random variables will be defined on some interval (or set of intervals). That is, we may take discrete random variables to be defined on \\(\\{0,1,2,3,\\dots,100\\}\\) or \\(\\{0,1,2,3,\\dots\\}\\) or \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)7. For continuous random variables we may take \\(X \\in [0,1]\\) or \\(X \\in (0,\\infty)\\) or \\(X\\in (-\\infty,129]\\).",

    "text": "Definition 5.1 (Random Variable) A random variable is a numeric quantity whose specific value depends on chance through the outcome of a statistical experiment. Formally, a random variable is a mapping from the result of an experiment to a set of numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.1 (Random Variables at the Coffee Shop) Back at their favourite coffee shop, Charles and Sadie are sitting in their favourite chairs, discussing random variables and watching the cash register for the inevitable sequence of customers who will arrive there. Charles suggests playing a game together, which is creatively called “how many random variables can we name that have to do with the statistical experiment of watching for customers at a cash register?” Seeing as how catchy the name is, Sadie is excited to play along, and so they start.\nName several distinct random variables which could be observed via the described statistical experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are essentially countless different random variables that could be named here, depending on what is of interest. The important concept is that each random variable needs to be a numeric quantity which is calculable from the statistical experiment. For instance:\n\nThe number of people who arrive at the cashier in the next hour.\nThe length of time until the next customer arrives at the cashier.\nThe amount of money that the next customer spends when paying at the cashier.\nA value of \\(1\\) if the next customer is wearing a hat, and a value of \\(0\\) otherwise.\nThe number of different items that are ordered by all customers over the next hour.\nThe number of words that the cashier says to the next customer, prior to payment.\nA count of the number of red items of clothing that can be seen being worn by the next \\(15\\) customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.2 (Expanding on Random Variables at the Coffee Shop) After tiring of their game of “how many random variables can we name that have to do with the statistical experiment of watching for customers at a cash register?”, Charles and Sadie fall into a deeper discussion of some of the some of their favourite random variables named during the play through. They take turns describing the support of a chosen random variable, as well as listing examples of simple and compound events that can be translated into the language of random variables.\nChoose a random variable identified in Example 5.1 and indicate its support, as well as possible simple and compound events that could be observed in terms of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we take \\(X\\) to be a random variable representing “The number of people who arrive at the cashier in the next hour.” The support of this random variable is likely best select as the non-negative integers. That is, we take \\[\\mathcal{X} = \\mathbb{N} = \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}.\\] There may be a reasonable maximal value for the random quantity (such as knowing the number of people who are within an hour radius of the coffee shop, or else knowing the number of people who are presently alive), however, the simpler “all non-negative integers” will likely suffice.\nFor simple events we may consider \\(\\{X = 0\\}\\) or \\(\\{X = 10\\}\\) or \\(\\{X = 31415\\}\\). In every case, the simple event takes the form \\(\\{X = x\\}\\).\nFor compound events we could consider \\(\\{X &gt; 0\\}\\), representing the event that at least one customer arises, we could consider \\(\\{X \\leq 10\\}\\), the event where no more than \\(10\\) customers show up, or we could consider something a little more abstract, like \\(X \\in \\{0, 3, 5, 9, 19, 25\\}\\) or \\(X\\) is an even number. In all these cases the key point is that compound events have more than one way of being satisfied (in that they correspond to more than one event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 5.2 (Discrete Random Variable) A discrete random variable is any random variable whose support is either finite or else countably infinite.\n\n\nDefinition 5.3 (Continuous Random Variable) A continuous random variable is any random variable whose support is uncountably infinite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountable and Uncountable Sets\n\n\n\n\n\nWe say that a set is countable whenever we can enumerate the elements of the set using the positive integers. If we have a set with a finite number of elements in it, then we say that it is countable because each element in the set can get assigned an integer value (just using \\(1\\) through to the cardinality of the set).\nIf we take a set like the positive integers, \\(\\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}\\), then this is an infinitely large set. However, it is still countable because we can assign each element of the set an integer value (just use the same integer it is corresponding to!). What if we have the set of positive, even integers ({2,4,6,8,})? Each of these is just \\(2\\) times one of the counting numbers, in order, and so these too are countable.\nWhat if we took the set of real numbers5 in the interval \\([0,1]\\)? In this case there is no way to map each of these values to the values \\(\\{1,2,3,4,\\dots\\}\\) and as a result the interval \\([0,1]\\) is not countable. It is infinitely large, but it remains infinitely large even after we have enumerated an infinite set of the items in it.\nA key difference between countable and uncountable sets is that, with a countable set, we can6 sum over the elements of the set. We cannot sum over the elements of an uncountable set, as there would be no way to actually order and enumerate the items. In these notes, the detailed mathematics of countable versus non-countable sets is tangential to the main point which is in distinguishing between discrete and continuous random variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.3 (The Countability of Coffee Shop Random Variables) Charles and Sadie have been discussing the features of all of the random variables they identified at the coffee shop for a long time when Sadie points out that they have not been differentiating between discrete and continuous random variables. Charles thinks “how could we have overlooked this?” and seeks to remedy the situation, immediately!\nList at least one discrete and one continuous random variable that could arise via the statistical experiment of watching the cashier at a coffee shop over time (as described in Example 5.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this we categorize the random variables originally defined in the solution to Example 5.1.\n\n“The number of people who arrive at the cashier in the next hour.”\n“The number of different items that are ordered by all customers over the next hour.”\n“The number of words that the cashier says to the next customer, prior to payment.”\n“A count of the number of red items of clothing that can be seen being worn by the next \\(15\\) customers.”\nThese are all discrete random variables, as the only values they can take on are the counting integer values.\n“The length of time until the next customer arrives at the cashier.” This is a continuous random variable, as it can take on any value over an interval (say, the interval \\((0,28800)\\) if the store is open for \\(8\\) hours and the customer were there the whole time).\n“The amount of money that the next customer spends when paying at the cashier.” This is a discrete random variable, as it must take a finite set of values. One way to make this clear is to count the value in cents, and then it will be only integer values.\n“A value of \\(1\\) if the next customer is wearing a hat, and a value of \\(0\\) otherwise.” This is a discrete random variable as it can only be from \\(\\{0,1\\}\\).",

    "section": "5.2 Probability Distributions and Probability Mass Functions",
    "text": "5.2 Probability Distributions and Probability Mass Functions\nWe will discuss continuous random variables later. For now, we turn our focus to discrete random variables. One of the major utilities of random variables is that they provide a shorthand for summarizing the results of a statistical experiment. To this end, there are several key concepts relating to random variables which help to expedite the analysis of the corresponding probabilities. Chief among these tools is the concept of a probability distribution.\n\nDefinition 5.4 (Probability Distribution) A probability distribution is a mathematical statement describing the probabilistic behaviour of a random variable.\n\nDistributions capture the underlying random behaviour of the random variables of interest, and in so doing, summarize information regarding the experiment or process that is being considered. When concerned with discrete random variables, we typically summarize probability distributions through the use of a probability mass function.\n\nDefinition 5.5 (Probability Mass Function) A probability mass function is a function, \\(p(x)\\), which maps possible values for a discrete random variable (the set \\(\\mathcal{X}\\)) to the probabilities corresponding to those events.8\n\nIf a random variable \\(X\\) has support \\(\\mathcal{X} = \\{x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_k\\}\\), then a probability mass function is a function \\(p(x)\\) such that \\(p(x_1) = P(X = x_1)\\), \\(p(x_2) = P(X = x_2)\\), and so on through to \\(p(x_k) = P(X=x_k)\\). Once a probability mass function is known, all of the probabilistic behaviour of the random variable is fully described.\n\nExample 5.4 (The Coin Game for Three) Sometimes Charlie and Sadie are joined by their friend Garth on their trips to the coffee shop. Also a probability aficionado, Garth contently joins in the game with Charles and Sadie where three coins are flipped, and depending on the results, one friend pays for the group. Garth’s order is typically less than Charles and Sadie and so Sadie proposes the following modified game.\n\nA fair coin is tossed three times. If all tosses of the coin show the same symbol, Garth pays. Otherwise, if there are more heads than tails, Charles pays. Finally, if there are more tails than heads, Sadie pays.\n\nHelp to simplify this statistical experiment by first defining a random variable, \\(X\\) which can be used to encode this game and then record the probability mass function of \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nOne choice of \\(X\\) is to allow \\(X\\) to be the number of heads that show on three tosses of the coin. In this case we have \\(\\mathcal{X} = \\{0,1,2,3\\}\\). If \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = 3\\) is observed then Garth pays. If \\(x = 2\\) is observed then Charles pays. Finally, if \\(x = 1\\) is observed, Sadie pays. Thus writing down the probability mass function for \\(X\\) also provides an easy way for computing the probability of each player having to pay.\nIn order for \\(X = 0\\), we must have all tails come up. There are \\(2^3 = 8\\) total possible sequences of \\(3\\) coin tosses, and only \\(1\\) of these results in \\(X = 0\\), therefore \\(P(X = 0) = p(0) = \\dfrac{1}{8}\\). The same logic applies to \\(X = 3\\) where we need to toss all heads. There are several techniques for finding \\(p(1)\\) and \\(p(2)\\).9 The most direct way is to recognize that there are exactly \\(3\\) ways of observing \\(1\\) head (it can be in the first, second, or third toss). Thus, \\(p(1) = \\dfrac{3}{8}\\). For \\(p(2)\\), the same logic applies except we ask “where is the one tail?” to give \\(p(2) = \\dfrac{3}{8}\\). Then, taken together, this results in \\[p(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{1}{8} & x \\in \\{0, 3\\} \\\\\n\\dfrac{3}{8} & x \\in \\{1, 2\\} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\] We can also read off from this result that Garth pays \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\) of the time in the long run, while Sadie and Charles each pay \\(\\dfrac{3}{8}\\) of the time.10\n\n\n\n\nThe previously outlined conditions for probabilities must still hold when using probability mass functions. As a result, we know that probabilities are all between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), and so we must have \\(0 \\leq p(x) \\leq 1\\), for all \\(x\\in\\mathcal{X}\\). Moreover, we saw previously that summing the probabilities over the full sample space gave a value of \\(1\\). Correspondingly, we must have that \\[\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} p(x) = 1.\\] These two properties are often used to define a valid probability mass function, and we can use these properties to both check whether a given mass function is valid and to turn a given function into a valid probability mass function.\n\nExample 5.5 (Charles’s Messy Writing Strikes Again) Charles is reading through some notes regarding a new game under development which, like most good games, relies at least a little bit on chance. In the notes there is a probability mass function written down, which, the best Charles can make out, reads \\[p(x) = \\begin{cases} 3c & x = 0 \\\\ 0.6 & x = 1 \\\\ 7c & x = 2.\\end{cases}\\] Frustrated with the illegibility, Charles brings the problem to Sadie who points out, if it really is \\(p(0) = 3c\\) and \\(p(2) = 7c\\), they actually have all the information required to solve the problem.\nWhat is the probability mass function, assuming Charles is reading it correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that two properties must be true of all probability mass functions. First \\(0 \\leq p(x) \\leq 1\\). Second, \\(\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} p(x) = 1\\). The first property tells us that \\(0 &lt; 3c &lt; 1\\) and that \\(0 &lt; 7c &lt; 1\\). This means that \\(c &gt; 0\\), and that \\(c &lt; 1/3\\) and \\(c &lt; 1/7\\). Using the second property we get that \\[1 = 3c + 0.6 + 7c \\implies 0.4 = 10c.\\] This tells us that \\(c = 0.04\\), which satisfies all of the previous properties. Taking \\(c = 0.04\\) gives a probability mass function of \\[p(x) = \\begin{cases} 0.12 & x = 0 \\\\ 0.6 & x = 1 \\\\ 0.28 & x = 2.\\end{cases}\\]\n\n\n\n\nWhen solving questions related to probabilities using a probability mass function, the same secondary properties apply. Notably, if we want to know \\(P(X\\in A)\\), for some set of possible values \\(A\\), then we can write \\[P(X\\in A) = \\sum_{x\\in A}p(x).\\] This can be particularly helpful, for instance, if we want to know \\(P(X \\leq c)\\) for some constant value \\(c\\). In this case we know that the possible values range from the smallest value \\(X\\) can take on, through to \\(c\\), giving for instance, \\[P(X\\leq c) = \\sum_{x=0}^c p(x),\\] if \\(X \\geq 0\\). These probabilities that consider the cumulative likelihood of \\(X\\) taking on a value up to (or including) some number arise frequently in probability, and correspondingly, are themselves named.\n\nDefinition 5.6 (Cumulative Distribution Function (Discrete)) The cumulative distribution function of a discrete random variable, \\(X\\), is denoted \\(F_X(x)\\), and is defined as the probability that \\(X\\) is less than or equal to a particular value. That is, \\[F_X(x) = P(X \\leq x) = \\sum_{x = -\\infty}^x p_X(x).\\] The summation is typically written starting at the smallest value of \\(X\\) rather than starting from \\(-\\infty\\).\n\nThe cumulative distribution function will be explored more thoroughly in Chapter 9. Generally, for discrete random variables, the cumulative distribution function is more complex than the probability mass function, and it often is only expressible directly through a summation. Despite this, you can always convert between the probability mass function and the cumulative distribution function, with each uniquely specifying the distribution of the random variable.\nThe same rules regarding the complements of events continue to hold when working with probability mass functions and cumulative distribution functions. For instance, \\[P(X &gt; c) = 1 - P(X\\leq c) = 1 - F_X(c),\\] giving a useful avenue for simplifying probability calculations.\n\nExample 5.6 (Charles and Sadie: Amateur Ornithologists) Charles and Sadie watched a documentary about birds together, which had Sadie become quite interested in bird watching. Charles is skeptical11 but agrees to go along with Sadie, supposing that there is a high enough probability of something interesting happening. Sadie scours the scholarly literature and determines that, in the area, the probability of seeing \\(x\\) rare birds over a five hour birding session has a probability mass function given by \\[p(x) = \\dfrac{e^{-3}3^x}{x!},\\] where \\(x\\geq 0\\).12\nWhat is the probability that during their bird watching adventure, Charles and Sadie see at least \\(1\\) rare bird?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are interesting in the probability \\(P(X \\geq 1)\\), which we can write down explicitly as \\[P(X \\geq 1) = \\sum_{x=1}^\\infty \\dfrac{e^{-3}3^x}{x!}.\\] While, strictly speaking, it is possible to solve this infinite summation, it is an infinite summation and we would rather not. Instead we can realize that, if we take the event \\(A = \\{X \\geq 1\\}\\) then \\(A^C\\) is the event \\(\\{X &lt; 1\\} = \\{X = 0\\}\\). As a result, using our elementary rules of probability we get that \\[P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - \\dfrac{e^{-3}3^{0}}{0!} = 1 - e^{-3} \\approx 0.95.\\] As a result, there is an approximately \\(0.95\\) probability that they see a rare bird while bird watching for five hours.\n\n\n\n\nWith events defined in terms of random variables, we can talk about events as being independent of each other or mutually exclusive using the familiar definitions. On a related note, we can talk of joint and conditional probabilities, relating to multiple events. With joint probabilities, it is often easiest to combine the event into a single, compound event, and find the marginal probability of that event. For instance, if you have the events \\(X\\) is even and \\(X \\leq 15\\), then the intersection of these events is \\(X \\in \\{2,4,6,8,10,12,14\\}\\) (supposing \\(X &gt; 0\\)).\n\nExample 5.7 (Charles: The Ornithological Photographer) After a single time bird watching Charles is hooked! The next time that they go out, Charles brings a camera to snag some beautiful memories of the majesty they are witnessing. The only trouble is that Charles is not particularly good at taking photographs of still subjects, let alone of creatures that can fly. Charles is not yet certain, but suspects that every time a photograph is snapped, there is a \\(0.1\\) probability that it turns out good. Because the camera is a film camera, the number of photos taken is a key metric, and Charles works out that, if \\(X\\) is the number of bad photographs taken for every good photograph, the probability mass function for \\(X\\) is given by \\[p(x) = (0.1)\\times (0.9)^{x},\\] where \\(x \\geq 0\\) is an integer.\n\nWhat is the probability that Charles takes exactly three bad photos before the first good one?\nIf \\(A\\) is the event that Charles takes three bad photos before the first good one, and \\(B\\) is the event that Charles takes more than four photos before the first good one, what is \\(P(A,B)\\)? What does this means about \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)?\nSuppose that Charles has taken \\(2\\) photos, both of which are bad. What is the probability that at least two more bad photos are taken before a good one?\nWhat is the probability that at least \\(2\\) bad photos are taken?\nDo the results of (c) and (d) suggest an independence?\nList two events, not previously described, which are independent of one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we want \\(p(3) = (0.1)\\times(0.9)^3 = 0.0729\\).\nConsidering \\(A \\cap B\\) we have \\(\\{X = 3\\} \\cap \\{X \\geq 4\\} = \\emptyset\\). As a result, \\(P(A,B) = 0\\) since there is no overlap between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). As a result, these events are mutually exclusive.\nHere, we can frame this probability as \\[P(X \\geq 4 | X \\geq 2)\\] This can be directly computed using the definition of conditional probability, \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(X \\geq 4 | X \\geq 2) &= \\dfrac{P(X \\geq 4, X \\geq 2)}{P(X \\geq 2)} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{P(X \\geq 4)}{1 - P(X &lt; 2)} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1 - P(X &lt; 4)}{1 - (0.1 + 0.1\\times0.9)} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1 - (0.1 + 0.1\\times 0.9 + 0.1\\times 0.9^2 + 0.1\\times0.9^3)}{1 - (0.1 + 0.1\\times 0.9)} \\\\\n&= 0.81.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThrough direct calculation we get \\[P(X \\geq 2) = 1 - P(X &lt; 2) = 1 - (0.1 + 0.1\\times 0.9) = 0.81.\\]\nCombining (c) and (d) we find that the probability that an additional two photos are required, given that two have already been taken, is the same as the probability that two photos are required, without knowing that any have been taken. While this feels like an independence type of property, it is not precisely independence. Note that the event \\(\\{X \\geq 4\\}\\) immediately gives the event \\(\\{X \\geq 2\\}\\) and so they cannot be independent of one another.13 For this to be independent we would require \\(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\\) which is not true of any of the events discussed.\nOne option is to consider the event \\(X \\geq 0\\) with any other event. Because \\(\\{X \\geq 0\\} = \\mathcal{X}\\), no information can be gained conditioning on this event.",

    "text": "5.3 Multiple Random Variables and Joint Probability Mass Functions\nWhile we can discuss independence, joint probabilities, and conditional probabilities relating to events on the same random variable, it is often of interest to combine multiple random variables. Sometimes these random variables will be multiple versions coming from the same distribution, and other times they will be coming from multiple different distributions. In either event, frequently our main concern is in summarizing the probabilistic behaviour of two or more random quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Discussion of Distributional Language\n\n\n\nNote that when we talk of a random variable “following” a particular distribution, we are saying that the probability mass function of the random variable is described by that distribution’s mass function. Thus, if two random variables “share a distribution”, we just mean that their probabilistic behaviour is described by the same underlying mass function.\nFor instance, if I flip a coin \\(10\\) times, and you flip a different coin \\(10\\) times, and we each count the number of heads that show up, we can say that the random quantity for the number of heads I observe will have the same distribution as the random quantity for the number of heads that you observe.\nThese two quantities are not equal, in general, but they are described by the same random processes.\n\n\nWhen we describe the distribution of a particular random variable, we are implicitly describing the marginal probabilities associated with that quantity. Just as before, the marginal probabilities describe the behaviour of the random variable alone. What happens when we want to be able to describe multiple components of an experiment, together? For this we require extending the idea of a joint probability beyond the concept of events.\nSuppose that we roll two six-sided fair dice. Let \\(X\\) denote the sum of the two dice, and let \\(Y\\) denote the maximum value showing on the two dice. \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable taking on values between \\(2\\) and \\(12\\), while \\(Y\\) is a discrete random variable taking on values between \\(1\\) and \\(6\\). The supports for the two random variables are different from one another and so immediately we know that their probabilistic behaviour must be different, despite the fact that both random variables summarize the same statistical experiment.\nWe can also immediately see that the two random variables, while not equal to each other, are dependent. For instance, if you know that \\(Y=1\\) then you know that \\(X = 2\\), and if you know that \\(Y = 3\\), then you know that \\(X \\leq 6\\). To begin to capture the joint behaviour of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) we introduce the joint distribution and joint probability mass function.\n\nDefinition 5.7 (Joint Distribution) A joint probability distribution describes the joint probabilistic behaviour of two or more random variables, simultaneously.\n\n\nDefinition 5.8 (Joint Probability Mass Function) A joint probability mass function describes the behaviour of the joint distribution of multiple random variables. For a set of random variables, \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\), the joint probability mass function assigns a probability value for every tuple of values that \\((X_1,\\dots,X_n)\\) can take on.\n\nThe joint probability mass function is analogous to the marginal probability mass function, only it considers joint events rather than marginal ones. Suppose that you have two random variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The joint probability mass function assigns a probability value for every pair of values that \\((X,Y)\\) can take on. That is, \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y)\\). Then, once you know the joint behaviour of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), you can fully summarize the combined behaviour of the underlying experiment.\n\nExample 5.8 (Charles and Sadie’s Bird Outings) Charles and Sadie have both gotten deeply into their ornithological adventures. They go on trips together, Sadie is responsible for spotting the rare birds, and then Charles for snapping the photos. Charles has settled on a camera setup that allows for \\(10\\) pictures to be taken before changing the film. The strategy that they follow is to go out and look for a rare bird. When one is spotted, Charles takes \\(10\\) photos, trying to get as many good photos as possible. Then, the film is replaced and they repeat the process.\nIf \\(X\\) is a random variable representing the number of good photos that are taken, and \\(Y\\) is the number of birds that are seen on the trip, then the joint probability mass function of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\[p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \\binom{10y}{x}\\times(0.25)^{x}\\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!},\\] with \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 10y\\), and \\(y \\geq 0\\).\n\nWhat is the probability that one bird is seen and there are no good photos taken?\nWhat is the probability that there is one or fewer good photos taken and two birds seen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we want \\(Y = 1\\) and \\(X = 0\\). Thus, we compute \\[p_{X,Y}(0, 1) = \\binom{10(1)}{0}\\times(0.25)^{0}\\times(0.75)^{10(1) - 0}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^1}{1!} \\approx 0.008411.\\]\nHere we want \\(\\{X \\leq 1\\}\\) and \\(Y = 2\\). This is the same as \\(X = 0\\) with \\(Y = 2\\) or \\(X = 1\\) with \\(Y = 2\\). Thus, \\[\\begin{align*}\np_{X,Y}(0,2) + p_{X,Y}(1,2) &= \\binom{10(2)}{0}\\times(0.25)^{0}\\times(0.75)^{10(2) - 0}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^2}{2!} \\\\\n&\\quad + \\binom{10(2)}{1}\\times(0.25)^{1}\\times(0.75)^{10(2) - 1}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^2}{2!} \\\\\n&\\approx 0.00547.\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Joint Probability Distributions as Contingency Tables\nIn practice, joint probability mass functions can be thought of as analogous to the contingency tables we previously saw. If the first variable represents the first random variable being considered, and the second variable represents the second random variable, then each cell of the contingency table assigns a probability to one of the joint events that could be observed in the experiment. Joint distributions are a useful generalization of contingency tables as they allow us to compactly represent not only two different random variables, but sometimes many more. All of the definitions used for the case of two random variables extend naturally to three, four, and beyond.\n\nExample 5.9 (Charles and Sadie: Rock-Paper-Scissors Experimentation) Charles and Sadie were once asked if rock-paper-scissors may be an easier way to solve their “who pays for coffee” dilemmas. Though both of them rejected the description of their coffee games as a “dilemma”, they had never really given it much thought. One day while bird watching, during a particularly long break with no birds, they begin to think through whether this could work or not. To this end, the friends play \\(1000\\) games, recording the results of each game into a contingency table. They suspect that this provides the true long run proportion of occurrences. To encode these games numerically, they take \\(X = -1\\), \\(X=0\\), and \\(X=1\\) to represent Charles playing rock, paper, and scissors respectively, and they take \\(Y = -1\\), \\(Y=0\\), and \\(Y=1\\) to represent the same events from Sadie.\n\n\n\n\n\\(Y=-1\\)\n\\(Y = 0\\)\n\\(Y = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(X=-1\\)\n400\n100\n50\n\n\n\\(X=0\\)\n10\n200\n40\n\n\n\\(X=1\\)\n50\n50\n100\n\n\n\nWhat is the joint probability mass function that corresponds to this contingency table?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can explicitly enumerate the possibilities to define the joint probability mass function. That is \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\begin{cases}\n0.4 & x = -1, y = -1 \\\\\n0.1 & x = -1, y = 0 \\\\\n0.05 & x = -1, y = 1 \\\\\n0.01 & x = 0, y = -1 \\\\\n0.2 & x = 0, y = 0 \\\\\n0.04 & x = 0, y = 1 \\\\\n0.05 & x = 1, y = -1 \\\\\n0.05 & x = 1, y = 0 \\\\\n0.1 & x = 1, y = 1.\n\\end{cases}\\] While it may be possible to express this in a more compact way, this fits the criteria for a joint probability mass function.",

    "section": "5.4 Independence of Random Variables",
    "text": "5.4 Independence of Random Variables\nIf we continue to consider the case of a bivariate (two variable) joint distribution, we can use this setting to introduce the independence of random variables. Recall that the joint probability mass function of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is a function, \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y)\\). We have also introduced the marginal mass functions, \\(p_X(x) = P(X = x)\\) and \\(p_Y(y) = P(Y = y)\\). Further, we have said that two events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), are independent if their joint probability is equal to the product of their marginal probabilities, that is \\(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\\).\nIf we take \\(A=\\{X=x'\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{Y=y'\\}\\), then if \\(A\\perp B\\) we can write \\(p_{X,Y}(x',y')=p_X(x')p_Y(y')\\). If this holds for every possible \\(x'\\) and every possible \\(y'\\), then we say that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent random variables, and we write \\(X \\perp Y\\).\n\nDefinition 5.9 (Independent Random Variables) Two random variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are said to be independent random variables if their joint probability mass function is given by the product of their marginal probability mass functions, \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x)p_Y(y).\\] We write \\(X\\perp Y\\), and read: \\(X\\) is independent of \\(Y\\).\n\nIn words, two random variables are independent whenever all possible combinations of events between them are independent.\n\nExample 5.10 (Charles the Sports Fan) Charles is a major sports fan and has been particularly fond of hurling ever since a trip to Ireland. Each week, Charles watches with deep investment, becoming very attached to the outcome. Because of this attachment, Charles is willing to do just about anything to help out from behind the television set, which mostly consists of wearing the right coloured clothing. Charles’s theory is that by increasing the number of articles of green clothing that are worn, the number of scores in the game will also increase.\nLet \\(X\\) represent the number of articles of green clothing that Charles is wearing, with \\(X \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}\\), and \\(Y\\) is the number of scores in the game. Suppose that \\[p_X(x) = \\dfrac{(x-2)^2}{10},\\] and that \\[p_Y(y) = \\dfrac{e^{-45}\\times 45^y}{y!}.\\]\n\nWhat is the joint probability mass function for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), assuming that they are independent?\nIf it is determined that, assuming Charles wears no green clothing, the probability of \\(50\\) scores is \\(0.01\\), are these random variables independent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(X\\perp Y\\), then the joint probability mass function is the product of the two, which is to say \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\dfrac{(x-2)^2}{10}\\cdot\\dfrac{e^{-45}\\times 45^y}{y!} = \\dfrac{e^{-45}}{10}\\times (x-2)^2 \\times \\dfrac{45^y}{y!}.\\]\nUsing the joint probability mass function found in (a), \\[p_{X,Y}(0, 15) = \\dfrac{e^{-45}}{10}\\times (0-2)^2 \\times \\dfrac{45^{50}}{(50)!} \\approx 0.017.\\] This is not equal to \\(0.01\\), and so it must be the case that \\(X\\not\\perp Y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.11 (The Independence Argument) Charles and Sadie are having a disagreement about the nature of the probabilities on their bird outings. Charles claims that, without knowing the marginal probability mass functions of the number of good pictures taken, and the number of rare birds that are seen, there is no way to tell whether the the two random quantities are independent or not. Sadie cannot say exactly why this argument feels wrong, but insists that the two quantities must not be independent.\nWho is correct, and why? Recall that \\[p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \\binom{10y}{x}\\times(0.25)^{x}\\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!},\\] with \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 10y\\), and \\(y \\geq 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case Sadie is correct. The most clear way of seeing this is by noting that the support set for \\(X\\) depends on \\(Y\\). The question to ask yourself is: how could two functions which are independent of one another multiply together so that one’s support depends on the other’s? It cannot happen. Put differently: we know that these cannot be independent as, if \\(Y=0\\) then \\(P(X=0)=1\\) as Charles will not take any pictures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquivalent Definition of Independence\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an equivalence between the described definition, and a slightly more intuitive definition for independence.\nWhenever \\(X\\perp Y\\) any two events corresponding to \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), say \\(X \\in A\\) and \\(Y \\in B\\) are independent. The subtle distinction is that in our previous definition, we were only concerned with simple events of the form \\(X=x'\\) or \\(Y=y'\\). Here we allow any two arbitrary events.\nNote that if we have the above definition holding for simple events, then \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(X \\in A, Y \\in B) &= \\sum_{x\\in A}P(X=x,Y\\in B) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in A}\\sum_{y \\in B} P(X=x,Y=y)\\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in A}\\sum_{y \\in B} p_X(x)p_Y(y) \\\\\n&= \\left(\\sum_{x\\in A}p_X(x)\\right)\\left(\\sum_{y\\in B}p_Y(y)\\right)\\\\\n&= P(X\\in A)P(Y\\in B).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nEven by only making the assumption for simple events, the conclusion regarding compound events follows naturally. Whenever any two random variables are known to be independent we know that any two events corresponding to these random variables will be independent. Moreover, we can directly write down the joint probability mass function by taking the product of the two marginals.",

    "section": "5.5 Conditional Probability Distributions",
    "text": "5.5 Conditional Probability Distributions\nWhen introducing events, we discussed how the concepts of independence and dependence could be understood more intuitively through the use of conditional probabilities. The same is true for random variables.\n\nDefinition 5.10 (Conditional Distributions) A conditional distribution of a random variable captures the probabilistic behaviour of a random variable, given information regarding another (or several other) random variables.\n\n\nDefinition 5.11 (Conditional Probability Mass Function) A conditional probability mass function assigns probability values associated with any conditional event between multiple random variables. For instance, if there are two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the conditional probability mass function of \\(X\\) given \\(Y\\) characterizes events of the form \\(X\\) given \\(Y=y\\). Mathematically, the conditional mass function is \\[p_{X|Y}(x|y) = \\dfrac{p_{X,Y}(x,y)}{p_Y(y)}.\\]\n\nThis definition is analogous to the formula for conditional probabilities more generally, give by the joint distribution over the marginal distribution. To determine the probability of any event (for \\(X\\)) given some information about \\(Y\\), you plug-in \\(X=x\\) and \\(Y=y\\) into the conditional probability mass function. If you want to condition on more than one random variable, the quantities extend in exactly the same way, where for instance \\[P(X=x|Y=y,Z=z)=\\dfrac{P(X=x,Y=y,z=z)}{P(Y=y,Z=z)}.\\]\n\nExample 5.12 (Charles Accepts the Argument) After some convincing, Charles accepts the argument that the number of good pictures taken and the number of rare birds seen cannot be independent events. What really makes this clear, however, is when Sadie points out that the marginal probability mass function for the number of rare birds seen is given by \\[p_{Y} = \\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}.\\] Taken together with the fact that \\[p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \\binom{10y}{x}\\times(0.25)^{x}\\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!},\\] with \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 10y\\), and \\(y \\geq 0\\), Charles realizes that the conditional distribution of \\(X|Y\\) can be computed.\n\nWhat is the conditional probability mass function of \\(X\\) given \\(Y\\)?\nGiven that \\(2\\) birds are seen, what is the probability that any good photos are taken?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the conditional probability mass function we take \\(p_{X,Y}(x, y)/p_{Y}(y)\\)$. This gives \\[p_{X|Y}(x|y) = \\dfrac{\\binom{10y}{x}\\times(0.25)^{x}\\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}}{\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}} = \\binom{10y}{x}\\times(0.25)^{x}\\times(0.75)^{10y - x}.\\]\nTo represent this, we want \\(P(X \\geq 1 | Y = 2)\\). From properties of probability, we know that \\(P(X \\geq 1 | Y = 2) = 1 - P(X &lt; 1 | Y = 2) = P(X = 0 | Y = 2)\\), and so using the conditional probability mass function found previously, this gives \\[P(X = 0 | Y = 2) = \\binom{20}{0}(0.25)^{0}\\times(0.75)^{20} = 0.75^{20}.\\] As a result, the probability of interest is \\(1-0.75^{20} \\approx 0.9968\\), which is the probability that Charles takes at least one good picture if two birds are seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs was discussed, the joint probability mass function of two independent random variables is given by the product of the marginals. If \\(X\\perp Y\\), then \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{X}(x)p_{Y}(y)\\). Combined with the expression for the conditional probability mass function this results in \\(p_{X|Y}(x|y) = p_X(x)\\). That is, whenever two variables are independent, the conditional probability mass function is exactly equal to the marginal probability mass function.\nWe saw that this was true for events, and the same reasoning applies here. This result gives an intuitive method for interpreting the independence of random variables. Two random variables are independent whenever any information about the one does not provide information about the other; when they are completely uninformative for one another. With this intuitive description it is easier to infer when independence of random variables is reasonable. Doing so is a useful skill for manipulating probability expressions.\n\nExample 5.13 (Charles Exploration of Independence) A little shaken after the previous independence mishap, Charles is committed to better understanding independence at an intuitive level. As a result, every time a pair of random quantities are seen together Charles has taken to deciding whether or not the underlying random variables would be independent.\nFor each of the following, indicate whether the pairs of random quantities are likely to be independent (and why).\n\nCharles is buying a butternut squash, and is considering the length of the squash (\\(X\\)) and the weight of the squash (\\(Y\\)) as the most relevant measurements.\nCharles is sitting at an intersection which has a separated bike path in front of it, and a lane of vehicular traffic. Take \\(X\\) to be the number of bikes passing by over a length of time, and \\(Y\\) to be the number of cars passing by over a certain time.\nAs the weekend comes around Charles prepares for the hurling match, once again considering whether the number of green items of clothing worn (\\(X\\)) has an impact on the number of scores (\\(Y\\)).\nCharles and Sadie are playing battle dice, where Charles rolls a die and compares the result (\\(X\\)) to the result of a separate die rolled by Sadie (\\(Y\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe length of a butternut squash and its weight are likely dependent. The longer a squash is, all else equal, the more likely it will be heavier, and vice versa. Both of these measure the size of the squash, and as a result, will be connected.\nThis is an interesting example which likely could be argued either way. On one hand, if cars and bikes do not mix, then the traffic of one will not likely impact the traffic on another. However, there are plenty of reasons why a larger number of bikes may suggest a certain number of cars: (1) perhaps more people bike on the weekends and fewer people drive on the weekends; (2) perhaps a city with more bikers has more cars; (3) perhaps more bikes represents a busy time of the day, which would also lead to more cars. It is challenging to know precisely where the impact stems from, it seems likely that there would be some relationship.\nThere is likely no impact of what Charles is doing and what is happening in a sporting match being watched on the TV. As a result, these two quantities should be independent.\nThe die roll from Charles has no impact on the die roll from Sadie, and vice versa. As a result, these two random variables will almost certainly be independent.",

    "text": "5.6 Manipulating Probabilities with Random Variables\nSeeing as the joint, marginal, and conditional probability mass functions are exactly analogous to the corresponding concepts when they were introduced regarding events, it is reasonable to assume that we can extend the multiplication rule, the law of total probability, and Bayes’ theorem to the framework of probability functions. Indeed, each of these relationships continues to hold for random variables in much the way that would be expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiplication Rule (with Probability Mass Functions)\n\n\n\nTranslating the multiplication rule to use probability mass functions gives \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{X|Y}(x|y)p_Y(y) = p_{Y|X}(y|x)p_X(x).\\] This can be seen by rearranging the relationship defining the conditional probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem (with Probability Mass Functions)\n\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem can be rewritten using probability mass functions as well. Specifically, \\[p_{Y|X}(y|x) = \\dfrac{p_{X|Y}(x|y)p_Y(y)}{p_X(x)}.\\] This follows directly from the definition of conditional probabilities, as well as the multiplication rule.\n\n\nThese rules give the ability to compute the joint distribution and the other conditional information, when we have information regarding some of the marginals and some of the conditionals. These properties are used less explicitly when dealing with probability mass functions directly. Instead, they almost become absorbed into the fabric of the defining relationships themselves. That is to say, you are less likely to see Bayes’ theorem invoked directly when moving between conditional distributions; however, moving between conditional distributions is an important skill, and requires the use of Bayes’ Theorem.\n\nExample 5.14 (Charles and the Chores) Charles has decided to take a break from having paid employment, instead taking time to help ensure that Sadie’s house runs smoothly as Sadie has been busy trying to write a novel. Unfortunately, sometimes chores are not done in a timely manner, despite Charles’s best efforts. While Sadie has been nothing but supportive, Charles decides to turn to probability to ease uncertainties.\nDefine \\(X=1\\) if a given chore was done by Charles, with \\(X=0\\) if it was done by Sadie. Let \\(Y=1\\) denote a chore being done on time with \\(Y = 0\\) if it was late. Suppose that \\[\\begin{align*}\np_{Y|X}(y|x) &= (0.5 + 0.4x)^{y}\\times(0.5 - 0.4x)^{1-y},\\\\\np_X(x) &= 0.85^{x}\\times(0.15)^{1-x},\\\\\np_Y(y) &= .85\\times(0.9)^y(0.1)^{1-y} + 0.075.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nWhat is the probability that a chore is late and done by Charles?\nWhat is the probability that, given a chore was done by Charles, it was done late? What about with Sadie?\nWhat is the probability that, given a chore was late, it was done by Charles? What about with Sadie?\nExplain how the results of (b) and (c) may result in Charles feeling responsible for the late chores. Is that accurate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this question, we require the joint probability mass function we apply the product rule. That is, \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{Y|X}(y|x)p_{X}(x) = (0.5 + 0.4x)^{y}\\times(0.5 - 0.4x)^{1-y}\\times0.85^{x}\\times(0.15)^{1-x}.\\] Then, to find the probability that a chore is late and done by Charles we take \\(p_{X,Y}(1,0) = 0.1\\times 0.85 = 0.085.\\)\nFor Charles, we want \\(P(Y=0|X=1)\\), which can be solved for directly using the provided conditional probability mass function. That is, \\[p_{Y|X}(0|1) = (0.5 + 0.4)^{0}\\times(0.5 - 0.4)^{1} = 0.1.\\] For Sadie, we want \\(P(Y=0|X=0)\\). This gives \\[p_{Y|X}(0|0) = (0.5)^{0}\\times(0.5)^{1} = 0.5.\\]\nHere we require the alternative conditional distribution, \\(P(X|Y)\\). For this we can leverage Bayes’ Theorem. Specifically, \\[p_{X|Y} = \\dfrac{p_{Y|X}(y|x)p_{X}(x)}{p_{Y}(y)} = \\dfrac{(0.5 + 0.4x)^{y}\\times(0.5 - 0.4x)^{1-y}\\times0.85^{x}\\times(0.15)^{1-x}}{.85\\times(0.9)^y(0.1)^{1-y} + 0.075}.\\] Then, the probability that Charles did the chore, given it was late, is \\(p_{X|Y}(1|0) = 0.53125\\) and the probability that Sadie did the chore, given it was late, is \\(p_{X|Y}(0|0) = 0.46875\\).\nTwo things are true with the given probabilities. First, if a chore was done late, it was more likely done by Charles than Sadie. Second, Sadie is more likely to do chores late than Charles. This explains why Charles may feel responsibility for the late chores: a higher proportion of late chores are Charles’s chores. However, that is only because Charles does so many more chores to begin (the probability that Charles does a chore is \\(0.85\\)).14\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the multiplication rule and Bayes’ theorem, the extension of the law of total probability is frequently cited when manipulating probability mass functions. It is a process which is important enough so as to warrant its own name: marginalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarginalization\n\n\n\nThe idea with marginalization is that we are going to take a joint probability mass function and marginalize it, turning it into a marginal distribution. This is analogous to the law of total probability.\nWhen dealing with a random variable, \\(Y\\), there is some set of numeric values that \\(Y\\) can take on, namely the support of \\(Y\\), which we denote \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\). A natural partition of the space is to then take each possible value for \\(Y\\) as the event, and enumerate through the elements of \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\).\nUsing this partition, we can ask about the ways that \\(X\\) can take on any particular value. In order for \\(X\\) to be some specific value, \\(x'\\), we know that \\(Y\\) must be one of the values, \\(y'\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\). Thus, if we add up all the possible combinations, \\((X=x',Y=y_1)\\), \\((X=x',Y=y_2)\\), and so forth, we will have covered every possible way of making \\(X=x'\\). This is the exact same process we used when looking at contingency tables, where we summed a row or column to get the marginal probabilities.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: This graphic shows the partitioning of the sample space using a random variable. It is entirely analogous to Figure 4.1, where in place of many different events, we partition over the set of values for \\(Y\\). Here, \\(\\mathcal{Y} = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking this argument and encoding it with mathematical notation we get that \\[P(X=x) = \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}} P(X=x, Y=y) \\implies p_X(x) = \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}} p_{X,Y}(x,y).\\] The process of marginalization involves summing over one of the random variables in a joint distribution, leaving behind only the marginal of the other. This is often a very effective way of determining a marginal distribution when information about two random variables is easier to discern than information about only one.\nTo complete the analogy to the law of total probability, recall that the multiplication rule tells us that \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{X|Y}(x|y)p_Y(y)\\), and so we may also marginalize by taking \\[p_X(x) = \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}} p_{X|Y}(x|y)p_Y(y).\\] This makes it clear that marginalization is often accomplished via arguments based on conditioning.\n\n\nWhen confronted with questions from statistics and probability, it will often be the case that the natural answer to the question is “it depends.” For instance, if asked “what is the probability that a student passes their next exam?” the likely response is “it depends.” One very useful technique for solving these questions in a satisfactory way is to continue that line of thought and explicitly specify “on what.” In the previous example, you may say “it depends on how much they study.” The conceit here is that, if you knew how much the student studied, then you would better understand the outcomes of the student’s exam.\nIn mathematical terms this means you have a firm belief about the conditional distribution between the random quantities of exam performance and study time. The process of marginalization, and the law of total probability before that, provide useful ways of being able to translate these “it depends” statements into concrete beliefs about the marginal probabilities. Recall that marginal distributions are distributions which do not depend on any other quantity, and instead, thy capture the overall behaviour of a random variable. They have, in some sense, averaged out all other factors and give you the beliefs which do not depend on anything else at all. The technique for accomplishing this is marginalization.15\n\nExample 5.15 (Photos and Bird Sightings on their Own) Recall that when Charles and Sadie go on their bird watching adventures, Charles takes photos hoping for as many good ones as possible, and Sadie spots the birds. We take \\(X\\) to be the number of good photos taken on these trips, and \\(Y\\) to be the number of rare birds that are seen. We noted that \\[p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \\binom{10y}{x}\\times(0.25)^{x}\\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!},\\] with \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 10y\\), and \\(y \\geq 0\\).\n\nWrite down an expression for the marginal probability mass function of \\(Y\\).\nWrite down an expression for the marginal probability mass function of \\(X\\).\nChallenge: solve for the marginal probability mass function of \\(Y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find \\(p_Y(y)\\), we marginalize over \\(X\\). That is, we sum the joint probability distribution function over all values for \\(X\\). This gives \\[p_Y(y) = \\sum_{x = 0}^{10y} p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \\sum_{x = 0}^{10y} \\binom{10y}{x}\\times(0.25)^{x}\\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}.\\]\nTo find \\(p_X(x)\\), we marginalize over \\(Y\\). That is, we sum the joint probability distribution function over all values for \\(Y\\). This gives \\[p_X(x) = \\sum_{y = 0}^{\\infty} p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \\sum_{y = 0}^{\\infty} \\binom{10y}{x}\\times(0.25)^{x}\\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}.\\]\nNote, that you will generally not be expected to manipulate these types of sums, however, it is possible to do. First, for \\(p_Y(y)\\), \\[\\begin{align*}\np_Y(y) &= \\sum_{x = 0}^{10y} \\binom{10y}{x}\\times(0.25)^{x}\\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\\times\\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}\\underbrace{\\sum_{x = 0}^{10y} \\binom{10y}{x}\\times(0.25)^{x}\\times(0.75)^{10y - x}}_{=1} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}.\n\\end{align*}\\]",

    "section": "5.7 Independent and Identically Distributed: A Framework for Interpretation",
    "text": "5.7 Independent and Identically Distributed: A Framework for Interpretation\nA very common assumption when addressing questions in statistics and in probability is that we have a set of random variables which are independent and identically distributed (often written iid). We now have the tools to understand concretely what this means.\n\nDefinition 5.12 (Independent and Identically Distributed (iid)) A set of random variables, \\(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n\\) are said to be independent and identically distributed (denoted iid) whenever:\n\nevery subset of random variables in the collection is independent of every other subset of random variables in the collection; and\nthe marginal distribution for each of the random variables are exactly the same.\n\n\nThe assumption of iid random quantities will often come up when we are repeating a process many times over, and thinking about what observations will arise from this. Suppose that \\(X_1\\) is a random variable that takes the value \\(1\\) if a flipped coin comes up heads, and \\(0\\) otherwise. If we imagine flipping this coin \\(100\\) times then it is reasonable to assume that each sequential coin flip will be independent of each other coin flip, since the result on one flip of a coin should not influence the result of any other flip of a coin. Moreover, every time the coin is flipped, it is reasonable to assume that the probability it shows up heads remains the same. As a result, these \\(100\\) random quantities, (\\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_{100}\\)), are said to be iid.\n\nExample 5.16 (Reframing the Bird Photos) Charles and Sadie had, to this point, been considering their bird photo taking adventures in terms of the joint and conditional distributions. After learning of independent and identically distributed random variables, Charles thinks that there is another way to frame the setup, and describes the following to Sadie:\n\nSuppose it is known that there will be \\(y\\) birds seen on any given day. Then, the total number of good pictures of birds can be viewed as the sum of the number of good pictures of each bird. Thus, we can take a set of iid random variables, say \\(X_1,\\dots,X_y\\) which represent the number of good pictures taken of each bird.\n\n\nIs this an accurate description? In reality, do we think that this will hold?\nSupposing that this description is accurate, and that the probability mass function for each \\(X_j\\) is given by \\[p_X(x) = \\binom{10}{x}(0.25)^{x}(0.75)^{10-x},\\] what is the joint probability mass function of \\((X_1,\\dots,X_y)\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, this is a reasonable explanation. In this case, if Charles is willing to assume that good photos for one bird do not impact the chances of good photos of another bird, then this is a perfectly valid way to frame the setting. Note that in this case, \\(Y=y\\) is still random, so this whole description is conditioning on knowing \\(Y=y\\). In the real world, it is likely that photos may not actually be independent. If Charles takes some really bad photos of one bird, that may impact the chances of taking good photos of the next. However, it is likely close enough to correct in order to be true.\nRecall that for independent random variables, the joint probability mass function is given by the product of the marginal probability mass functions. To simplify the notation, we will define \\(T(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^y x_i\\). Thus the probability mass function of \\(X_1,\\dots,X_y\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*}\np_{X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_y}(x_1,\\dots,x_y) &= \\prod_{i=1}^y \\binom{10}{x_i}(0.25)^{x_i}(0.75)^{10-x_i} \\\\\n&= \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^y\\binom{10}{x_i}\\right)\\times(0.25)^{\\sum_{i=1}^y x_i}(0.75)^{10y - \\sum_{i=1}^yx_i} \\\\\n&= \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^y \\dfrac{10!}{x_i!(10-x_i)!}\\right)\\times 0.25^{T(X)}\\times 0.75^{10y - T(X)} \\\\\n&= \\left(\\dfrac{(10!)^y}{\\prod_{i=1}^y x_i!(10 - x_i)!}\\right)\\times 0.25^{T(X)}\\times 0.75^{10y - T(X)}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we will use the assumption of iid random variables explicitly at a later point, the iid assumption also provides an intuitive method for interpreting probability functions and distributions.\nSuppose that we were to take a probability mass function, \\(p_X(x)\\). If we were able to generate independent and identically distributed realizations from this probability mass function, then the function \\(p_X(x)\\) describes the behaviour for these repeated realizations. Specifically, \\(p_X(x)\\) will give the long-run proportion of realizations of the iid random variables which take the value \\(x\\).\nThis type of statement is always the flavour of interpretation statements that are made with respect to probability and statistics. It is always be the case that, in order to understand what is meant by a statement of probability, we consider the repetition of some statistical experiment over and over again. When we were discussing sample spaces and experiments directly, we talked about repeating the experiment over and over again. When we begin to work with random variables instead, it becomes more natural to think about the replication procedures coming through the use of independent and identically distributed random variables.\nAs your study of probability progresses, you will begin to work with random quantities in a strictly theoretical sense. In introductory level problems, we are often holding in mind very concrete examples to illustrate the procedures and concepts. In this setting it is easy enough to hold in mind the experiment of interest: for instance, we may have a random variable representing the result of a coin toss, and you can envision repeatedly tossing a coin. As the concepts become less concrete, more abstract, and harder to draw direct parallels to tangible scenarios, it becomes more and more important to rely on the interpretations rooted in a series of independent and identically distributed random variables.\nA large component of statistics as an area of study is making explicit the assumptions we are working with, and doing our best to ensure that these are reasonable. By interpreting probability mass functions as the proportion of independent and identically distributed random variables that take on a particular value when we repeatedly take realizations of these random variables, this philosophy is made clear and explicit.",

    "text": "Recall our discussions of combinatorics.↩︎\nWe can actually discuss probabilities revolving around \\(x\\), but they are all deeply uninteresting. Every probability will either be \\(1\\), or \\(0\\). If I tell you that \\(x = 5\\), then \\(P(x=5) = 1\\) and \\(P(x = 2) = 0\\). While this is not a particularly interesting probability statement, it is true, and somewhat surprisingly, can arise in meaningful ways.↩︎\nThe support of a random variable is directly analogous to the sample space from the statistical experiment. That is, it is the set of possible observations which can be made of the random variable. As a result, it is sometimes permissible to call the support the “sample space of the random variable”, in an informal manner. The informality here is important. Formally, a random variable \\(X\\) is a function which maps from the sample space to its support, which is to say \\(X \\colon \\mathcal{S}\\to\\mathcal{X}\\).↩︎\nThat is to say, events in the case of random variables are subsets of \\(\\mathcal{X}\\).↩︎\nRecall that “real numbers” are just all of the standard numbers that we think of (decimals, whole numbers, fractions, negative values, etc.).↩︎\n(in principle)↩︎\nThis notation refers to the set of all integers↩︎\nThat is, \\(p(x)\\) is a function, \\(p\\colon\\mathcal{X}\\to[0,1]\\).↩︎\nOne particularly elegant technique is to realize that \\(p(1)\\) and \\(p(2)\\) must be the same by interchanging the roles of heads and tails. Thus, we have \\(p(1) + p(2) + 0.25 = 1\\) by the unitary property of probability, and rearranging gives \\(p(1) = p(2) = 0.375\\).↩︎\nWe can actually write down this probability mass function more succinctly as \\(p(x) = \\binom{3}{x}\\dfrac{1}{8}\\).

    "text": "6.1 Summarizing the Location of a Distribution\nUntil this point in our discussions of probability we have relied upon characterizing the behaviour of a random variable via the use of probability mass functions. In some sense, a probability mass function captures all of the probabilistic behaviour of a discrete random variable. Using the mass function you are able to characterize how often, in the long run, any particular value will be observed, and answer any questions associated with this. As a result, the mass function remains a critical area of focus for understanding how random quantities behave.\nHowever, these functions need to be explored and manipulated in order for useful information to be extracted from them. They do not summarize this behaviour effectively, as they are not intended to be a summary tool. We may wish to have numeric quantities which are able to concisely express the behaviour of a distribution. Put differently, provided with a probability mass function it is hard to immediately answer “what do we expect to happen with this random variable?” despite the fact that this is a very obvious first question.\nTo address questions related to our expectations, we turn towards the statistical concept of central tendency or location.\nWith measures of location we are trying to capture, with one single number, what value is expected when we make observations from the random quantity. There are many ways one might think to describe our expectations, and it is worth exploring these concepts in some detail. In particular, we want to explore how we might think to define the expected value of a distribution.1",

    "text": "6.2 Deriving the Expected Value\n\n6.2.1 The Mode\nOne way that we may think to define our expected value is by asking what value is the most probable. This is a question which can be directly answered using the probability mass function. The process for this requires looking at the function and determining which value for \\(x\\) corresponds to the highest probability. This is the value that we are most likely to see. Sometimes this procedure is fairly straightforward, sometimes it is quite complicated. Regardless of the complexity of the specific scenario, the most probable value has a straightforward interpretation. As intuitive as this may seem, this is not the value that will be used as the expected value generally. Instead, this quantity is referred to as the mode.\n\nDefinition 6.2 (Mode) The mode of a distribution is the most probable value of that distribution. Specifically, if \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable with mass function \\(p_X(x)\\), then the mode is the value of \\(x\\) such that \\(p_X(x)\\) is maximized.\n\n\nExample 6.1 (Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Sprinkles) Charles and Sadie have noticed that their favourite coffee shop has been experiencing less foot traffic ever since Probability Patisserie: Cupcake Conundrums has opened up next door.2 This cupcake shop has been attracting many of the regular customers, though, Charles and Sadie think that it has more to do with fancy marketing than with a better product. To this end, they go into the store and workout the probability mass function for \\(X\\), the number of sprinkles on top of the cupcakes. They find the following \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases} 0.25 & x = 0 \\\\ 0.3 & x = 1 \\\\ 0.1 & x = 2 \\\\ 0.05 & x \\in \\{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\]\nWhat is the mode for the number of sprinkles on the cupcakes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mode is the value \\(x\\) such that \\(p_X(x)\\) is a maximum. In this case the maximum occurs when \\(x=1\\), with \\(p_X(1) = 0.3\\), and so the mode of the number of sprinkles is \\(1\\).\n\n\n\n\nWhile the mode is a useful quantity, and for some decisions will be the most relevant summary value, there are some major issues with it as a general measure of location. For starters, consider that our most common probability model considered until this point has been that of equally likely outcomes. Here, there is no well-defined mode.3 While the case of equally likely outcomes is a fairly strong example highlighting the issues with the mode, it need not be so dramatic to undermine its utility. It is possible for a distribution to have several modes which are quite distinct from one another, even if it’s not all values in the support.\nMoreover, it is quite common for the modal value to be not particularly likely itself. Consider a random variable that can take on a million different values. If all of the probabilities are approximately \\(0.000001\\) then presenting the mode as the most probable value does not translate to saying that the mode is particularly probable.\n\nExample 6.2 (Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Happiness) After realizing that the cupcake shop did not provide very many sprinkles, Charles and Sadie decided to turn to the marketing material. In it, Cupcake Conundrums claims that, on a scale from \\(0\\) to \\(100,000\\) happiness points, most of their customers experience the maximum happiness after eating their cupcakes. Charles and Sadie are well aware of the ways in which these types of reports can be misleading, and so they investigate, finding the following probability mass function for the number of happiness points. \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases}\n    \\frac{x}{5,000,050,000} & x \\in \\{1,\\dots,100 000\\} \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\nIs the mode reported by the company correct?\nIs the mode an accurate depiction of the distribution in this setting?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Note that \\(p_X(x)\\) is increasing in \\(x\\). As a result, the mode of the distribution is the highest value that the distribution can take on, which in this case is \\(x = 100,000\\).\nThe mode is likely not a good indication of the distribution. Note that the maximal value happens only \\(100000/5000050000\\) of the time, which is a very very small value. If you look at the probability that a customer is only halfway happy, this is \\(50000/5000050000\\). This value is half the likelihood of the modal value, but the difference between these two probabilities is also only \\(50000/5000050000 \\approx 0.000001\\). That is, it is only \\(1\\) in \\(100,000\\) more likely to observe perfect happiness compared with half happiness. By extension, it is only about \\(2\\) in \\(100,000\\) more likely to observe perfect happiness compared with no happiness. The mode simply is not a good indicator of behaviour in this setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 The Median\nIf the mode has these shortcomings, what else might work? Another intuitive concept is to try to select the “middle” of the distribution. One way to define the middle would be to select the value such that, in the long run, half of observations from the distribution are beneath it and half are above it. That way, when you are told this value, you immediately know that it is equally likely to observe values on either side of this mark. This is also a particularly intuitive definition for expected value, and is important enough to be named, the median.\n\nDefinition 6.3 (Median) The median of a distribution is the value \\(m\\) which attempts to have \\(P(X \\leq m) = 0.5\\) and \\(P(X \\geq m) = 0.5\\). This value may not always exist, and so formally for discrete random variables, the median \\(m\\) is any value such that \\(P(X \\leq m) \\geq 0.5\\) and \\(P(X \\geq m) \\geq 0.5\\).\n\nThe median is the midpoint of a distribution and is very important for describing the behaviour of random variables. Medians are often the most helpful single value to report to indicate the typical behaviour of a distribution, and they are frequently used. When people interpret averages it is often the median that they are actually interpreting. It is very intuitive to be given a value and know that half of all realizations are above that point, and half of all realizations are below that point.\n\nExample 6.3 (Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Sprinkles (Again)) After seeing how the cupcake shop used the mode to misrepresent the happiness of its customers, Charles and Sadie worry that they may have been unfair with using the mode. As a result, they turn back to the cupcake sprinkle distribution and try to summarize it differently. Recall that the probability mass function for \\(X\\), the number of sprinkles on top of the cupcakes, is \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases} 0.25 & x = 0 \\\\ 0.3 & x = 1 \\\\ 0.1 & x = 2 \\\\ 0.05 & x \\in \\{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\]\nWhat is the median number of sprinkles on the cupcakes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we are looking for a value, \\(m\\), such that \\(P(X \\geq m) \\geq 0.5\\) and \\(P(X \\leq m) \\geq 0.5\\). To find this we can consider the cumulative probability sums. We know that \\(P(X \\leq k) = \\sum_{x=0}^k p_X(x)\\), and as a result, stopping this value at the first time that the sum goes beyond \\(0.5\\) satisfies the second condition. In this case our cumulative sums are \\(0.25\\) then \\(0.55\\). As a result, \\(P(X \\leq 1) = 0.55 &gt; 0.5\\). If we check \\(P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - P(X &lt; 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 0.75 &gt; 0.5\\). As a result, \\(m=1\\) satisfies the required conditions and is a median.\n\n\n\n\nDespite the advantages of medians, they have their own drawbacks. For starters, the median can be exceptionally challenging to compute in certain settings. As a result, even when a median is appropriate, it may not be desirable if it is too challenging to determine.\nBeyond the difficulties in computation, medians have a feature which is simultaneously a major benefit and a major drawback. Specifically, medians are less influenced by extreme values in the probability distribution. Consider two different distributions. The first is equally likely to take any value between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\). The second is equally likely to take any value between \\(1\\) and \\(9\\) or \\(1,000,000\\). In both of these settings, the median is \\(5\\) since \\(P(X\\leq 5) = 0.5\\) and \\(P(X \\geq 5) = 0.5\\). However, in the second setting we may observe a value as high as \\(1,000,000\\). Moreover, this value will be observed as often as the median will be.\nThe median, in some sense, ignores the extreme value in the probability distribution. In certain settings, this can be very desirable.4 Consider the distribution of household incomes. There are a few households that earn an incredibly large amount, compared to the remaining households. If you are interested in understanding the “average household”, the median may be a more appropriate measure, as those households with extreme incomes would otherwise distort the picture provided by most families. In this sense, the median’s robustness to extreme values is a positive feature of it in terms of a summary measure for distributional behaviour.\nSuppose instead that you work for an insurance company and are concerned with understanding the value of insurance claims that your company will need to pay out. The distribution will look quite similar to the income distribution. Most of the probability will be assigned to fairly small claims, with a small chance of a very large one. As an insurance company, if you use the median this large claim behaviour will be smoothed over, perhaps leaving you unprepared for the possibility of extremely large payouts. In this setting, the extreme values are informative and important, and as a result the median’s robustness becomes a hindrance to correctly describing the important behaviour.5\n\nExample 6.4 (Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Public Relations) Charles and Sadie feel as though they may be finally catching a break when word gets around that the cupcake shop was using spoiled ingredients, making the patrons sick! The cupcake shop, in hearing this, sent their massive public relations team into damage control mode. They claimed that the median number of illnesses per week associated with the cupcake store was the same as most local food services businesses. Doing some digging, Charles and Sadie find the following two probability mass functions, for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), where \\(X\\) is the number of weekly illnesses at the cupcake shop, and \\(Y\\) is the number from a local business that has been around for a while. \\[\\begin{align*}\np_X(x) &= \\begin{cases}\n    0.1 & x = 0 \\\\\n    0.1 & x = 1 \\\\\n    0.35 & x = 2 \\\\\n    0.05 & x = 3 \\\\\n    0.4 & x = 25 \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise};\n\\end{cases} \\\\\np_Y(y) &= \\begin{cases}\n    0.45 & x = 0 \\\\\n    0.04 & x = 1 \\\\\n    0.5 & x = 2 \\\\\n    0.01 & x = 3\n\\end{cases}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nWhat is the median of \\(X\\)?\nWhat is the median of \\(Y\\)?\nIs the claim made by the public relations team an accurate depiction of the world? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can consider cumulative sums here again. In order we get, \\(0.1\\), \\(0.2\\), \\(0.55\\). This suggests that \\(x=2\\) is a candidate. If we check \\(P(X \\geq 2) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\\), and so \\(x=2\\) is a median.\nUsing cumulative sums we get \\(0.45\\), \\(0.49\\), \\(0.99\\). Again, this gives \\(x=2\\) as a candidate. If we check \\(P(X \\geq 2) = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51\\), and so \\(x=2\\) is a median.\nThe claim is accurate in that the median number for both establishments in \\(2\\). However, here the median is a bad representation for \\(X\\). The probability that more than \\(2\\) cases occur in a week at the cupcake shop is \\(0.8\\), compared with \\(0.51\\) at the local business. What’s more, the probability that \\(X\\) is as high as \\(25\\) is \\(0.4\\), where \\(Y\\) is never higher than \\(3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween the median and the mode we have two measures which capture some sense of expected value, each with their own set of strengths and drawbacks. Neither capture what it is that is referred to as the expected value. For this, we need to take inspiration from the median, and consider another way that we may think to find the center of the distribution.\n\n\n6.2.3 The Mean\nIf the median gives the middle reading along the values sequentially, we may also wish to think about trying to find the center of gravity of the numbers. Suppose you take a pen, or marker, or small box of chocolates, and you wish to balance this object on a finger or an arm. To do so, you do not place the item so that half of its length sits on one side of the appendage and half on the other. You adjust the location so that half of the mass sits on either side of the appendage.\nThroughout our discussion of discrete random variables we have referred to probability as mass. We use the probability mass function to generate our probability values. This metaphor can be extended when we try to find the center of the distribution. If we imagine placing a mass with weight equal to the probability mass at each value that a random variable can take on, we may ask, “where would we have to place a fulcrum to have this number line be balanced?” The answer to this question serves as another possible measure of center. It turns out that this notion of center is the one that we are all most familiar with, the simple average, or mean.\n\nDefinition 6.4 (Mean) The mean of a distribution is the center of mass of the distribution. For a random variable, \\(X\\) with support \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), and probability mass function \\(p_X(x)\\), the mean of \\(X\\) is given by \\[\\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} xp_X(x).\\]\n\nIt is this measure of location which ends up being called the expected value in statistics. We will use average, expected value, mean, and expectation interchangeably. In terms of notation, the expected value of a random variable \\(X\\) is denoted \\(E[X]\\). Mathematically, the expected value is desirable for many reasons, some of which we will study in more depth later on. One of these desirable features, which stands in contrast with the median, is the comparative ease with which expected values can be computed. The summation for the expected value is easy to write down, and typically can be solved (either analytically, or readily with a computer).\n\nExample 6.5 (Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Sprinkles (One Last Time)) While the median and mode number of sprinkles on the cupcakes were the same, Charles and Sadie realize that this does not end up connecting well with the total number of sprinkles given out. Perhaps customers like the possibility of getting a large number of sprinkles, if they get lucky. As a result, they decide to round out the summary of the distribution by considering the mean number of sprinkles as well. Recall that the probability mass function for \\(X\\), the number of sprinkles on top of the cupcakes, is \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases} 0.25 & x = 0 \\\\ 0.3 & x = 1 \\\\ 0.1 & x = 2 \\\\ 0.05 & x \\in \\{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\]\nWhat is the mean number of sprinkles?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the mean of a distribution is given by \\(E[X] = \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}xP_X(x)\\). In this case, this results in \\[\\begin{align*}\n    &\\sum_{x=0}^9 xp_X(x) \\\\\n    &= 0(0.25) + 1(0.3) + 2(0.1) + (3+4+5+6+7+8+9)(0.05) \\\\\n    &= 2.6.\n\\end{align*}\\] As a result, the mean number of sprinkles used is \\(2.6\\). This is higher than the median and mode, but is still not particularly high.\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of an equally likely probability model, the expected value becomes the standard average that is widely used. Suppose that there are \\(n\\) options in the support with \\(\\mathcal{X} = \\{x_1,\\dots,x_n\\}\\). We can write \\[E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i.\\] This is the formula for the average that is most commonly applied. When the probability models are more complex, the formula is not precisely the standard average – instead, it becomes a weighted average, where the weights are the probabilities.6 The frequency with which expected values are used make them attractive as a quick summary for the center of a distribution.\n\n\n6.2.4 How is the Mean “Expected”?\nWhile the mean provides a useful, intuitive measure of center of the distribution, it is perhaps counterintuitive to name it the “expected value.” To understand the naming convention it is easiest to consider the application which has likely spurred more development of statistics and probability than any other: gambling.\nSuppose that there is some game of chance that can pay out different amounts with different probabilities. A critical question for a gambler in deciding whether or not to play such a game is “how much can I expect to earn, if I play?” This is crucial to understanding, for instance, how much you should be willing to pay to participate, or if you are the one running the game, how much you should charge to ensure that you make a profit.\nIf you want to understand what you expect to earn, the intuitive way of accomplishing this is to weight each possible outcome by how likely it is to occur. This is exactly the expected value formula that has been provided, and so the expected value can be thought of as the expected payout of a game of chance where the outcomes are payouts corresponding to each probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost for a Game of Chance\n\n\n\nSuppose that a game of chance is being run. It will cost \\(\\$m\\) to play, and the game will pay out values from \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), according to a random variable \\(X\\) with probability mass function \\(p_X(x)\\). The question that we want to know is what should the value be for \\(m\\), such that, in the long term, a player playing the game will earn no money?\nNote that if \\(X=x\\) then a player playing the game will earn \\(x - m\\) for that play, and this will happen with probability \\(p_X(x)\\). Thus, in the long run, in \\(p_X(x)\\) proportion of games the player earns \\(x-m\\). If the player plays \\(N\\) games, then as \\(N\\to\\infty\\), the total contribution from these winnings will be \\((x-m)\\cdot N\\cdot p_X(x)\\). If we add up this contribution for all possible results, \\(x\\), we get \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} N(x-m)p_X(x) &= N\\left[\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) - \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} mp_X(x)\\right] \\\\\n&= N\\left[\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) - m\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}p_X(x)\\right] \\\\\n&= N\\left[E[X] - m\\right].\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, in the long run, the total that the player wins, as \\(N\\to\\infty\\) will be \\(N(E[X] - m)\\). Thus, in order for the long run earnings to be zero, \\(m\\) should be set to be equal to \\(E[X]\\).\nIf \\(m\\) is set to be \\(0\\), then per game the player expects to earn \\(E[X]\\). This also represents the cost at which a rational actor should be willing to pay to participate. If a game of chance costs more than the expected value to play, in the long run you will lose money. If a game of chance costs less than the expected value, in the long run you will earn money. It is hard to overstate the utility of gambling in developing probability theory, and as such these types of connections are expected.\n\n\nTo interpret the expected value of a random variable, one possibility is using the intuition that we used to derive the result. Notably, the expected value is the center of mass of the distribution, where the masses correspond to probabilities. This means that it is not necessarily an actual central number over the range, but rather that it sits in the weighted middle. While this interpretation is useful in many situations, there are times where the point of balance is a less intuitive description. For these, it can sometimes be useful to frame the expected value as the long term simple average from the distribution.\nIf we imagine observing many independent and identically distributed random variables, then as the number of samples tends to infinity, the expected value of \\(X\\) and the simple average will begin to coincide with one another. That is the distance between \\(E[X]\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\) will shrink to \\(0\\). As a result, we can view the expected value as the average over repeated experiments. This interpretation coincides nicely with the description based on games of chance. Specifically, if you were to repeatedly play the same game of chance, the average payout per game will be equal to the expected value, if you play for long enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: This plot produces 50000 realizations of the random variable described in Example 6.5. As computed in the example, the expected value is 2.6. As many repeated observations are averaged, the empirical average converges to this computed value.",

    "text": "6.3 Which Measure of Central Tendency Should be Used?\nWhere the median demonstrated robustness against extreme values in the distribution, the mean does not. For instance, if we consider the distribution of incomes across a particular region, the mean will be much higher than the median, since those families with exceptionally high incomes will not be smoothed over as they were with medians. In this case, the lack of robustness for the expected value will render the mean a less representative summary for the true behaviour of the random quantity.\nTo see this concretely consider a random variable which with equal probability takes a value between \\(1\\) and \\(9\\). This will have \\(E[X] = 5\\). Now, if the \\(9\\) is made to be \\(1,000,000\\), the expected value will now be \\(E[X] = 111115.\\dot1\\). This is a far cry from the median which does not change from \\(5\\) in either case. This lack of robustness is desirable in the event of the insurance example from the median discussion, but will be less desirable in other settings.\nThe mean, median, and mode are the three standard measures of central tendency. They are single values which describe the standard behaviour of a random quantity. Each of the three has merits as a measure, and each has drawbacks for certain settings. The question of which to use and when depends primarily on the question of interest under consideration, rather than on features of the data alone.7 Often, presenting more than one measure can give a better sense of the distributional behaviour that any one individual will.\n\nExample 6.6 (Charles and Sadie Reflect on the Cupcake Adventures) Charles and Sadie decide it is worth stepping back and summarizing all that has happened with regards to their cupcake adventures, trying to ensure that distributions are always summarized fairly.\n\nFor the number of sprinkles per cupcake is the mean, median, or mode the best measure of central tendency?\nFor the amount happiness in customers, is the mean, median, or mode the best measure of central tendency?\nFor the number of customers who become ill eating at establishments, is the mean, median, or mode the best measure of central tendency?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an argument that any of the measures here could work the best, it would depend on the individual’s preferences. The mode makes a lot of sense as, if you are a regular customer, the mode is what you will experience day-to-day; most days you will have the modal number of sprinkles. The median may make sense as it provides a benchmark for measuring what constitutes a lot of sprinkles and a little. Half of the time you’ll end up with a more sprinkled donut, half the time a less. The mean would be particularly interesting to note for the store owners themselves, since the mean is directly tied to totals: if the store knows that they sell \\(100\\) cupcakes per day, most days, then they also can expect to use \\(100\\) times the mean number of sprinkles in a day. This is helpful for planning.\nThe median is likely the most useful measure in this setting. The mode could be useful if happiness were not measured on a \\(100,000\\) point scale. The mean is likely a less relevant value here as we are not particularly concerned with the total happiness, and if there was a large skew or major outliers in this distribution, we would want to determine where the majority fall. This is more analogous to the income example rather than the insurance example.\nIn this case either the mode or mean are likely the best gauges. Here we do care about totals, and in particular, we do not want to smooth over outliers. It is very relevant if sometimes a lot of individuals become ill after eating an establishment, and the median would hide this information.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the utility of all three measures, the expected value holds a place of more central importance in probability and statistics. A lot of this has to do with further mathematical properties of the mean. Because of its central role, it is worth studying the expected value in some more depth.",

    "text": "6.4 Expected Values of Functions of Random Variables\nSometimes the value of a random variable needs to be mapped through a function to give the value which is most relevant to us. Consider, for instance, a situation wherein the side lengths of boxes being manufactured by a specific supplier are random, due to incorrectly calibrated tolerances in the machines. The resulting boxes are perfect cubes. Suppose we are interested in the volume of the produced box not the side length. If a box has side length \\(x\\), then its volume will be \\(x^3\\), and so we may desire some way of computing \\(E[X^3]\\) rather than \\(E[X]\\).\nGenerally, for a function \\(g(X)\\), we may want to compute \\(E[g(X)]\\). It is important to recognize that \\(E[g(X)] \\neq g(E[X])\\). This is a common mistake.8 If we are unable to apply the function to the expected value, then the question of how to compute the expected value remains. Instead of applying the function to overall expected value, instead, we apply the function to each value in the defining relationship for the expected value. That is, \\[E[g(X)] = \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} g(x)p_X(x).\\] This is sometimes referred to as the “law of the unconscious statistician,” a name which may be aggressive enough to help remember the correct way to compute the expectation.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Law of the Unconscious Statistician\n\n\n\nThe law of the unconscious statistician (LOTUS) states that, for a random variable \\(X\\), if we wish to find \\(E[g(X)]\\), then we compute \\[E[g(X)] = \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} g(x)p_X(x).\\]\n\n\n\nExample 6.7 (The Happiness Scale Inversion) Charles and Sadie have made really great strides working to protect their favourite coffee shop from the new cupcake store. One day when digging through the material more, they realize that the happiness report produced by the company is even less accurate than they had originally reported! The company reported the following probability mass function for happiness points \\[\np_X(x) = \\begin{cases}\n    \\frac{x}{5,000,050,000} & x \\in \\{1,\\dots,100 000\\} \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\\] Charles and Sadie track down the source of this expression and they find that, in fact, this does not measure happiness points at all. Instead, the number of happiness points is a function of \\(X\\), specifically, \\(Z = 1/X\\).\n\nWhat is the expected value of \\(X\\)? Note, it may be helpful to recall that \\(\\sum_{x=1}^{k} x^2 = \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}\\).\nWhat is the expected value of \\(Z\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing directly the formula for \\(E[X]\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X] = \\sum_{x=1}^{100000} xp_X(x) &= \\sum_{x=1}^{100000} x\\frac{x}{5000050000} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{5000050000}\\sum_{x=1}^{100000}x^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{5000050000}\\cdot\\frac{100000(100000+1)(2(100000)+1)}{6} \\\\\n&= 66 667.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nApplying the law of the unconscious statistician, gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[Z] = E[1/X] = \\sum_{x=1}^{100000} \\frac{1}{x}p_X(x) &= \\sum_{x=1}^{100000} \\frac{1}{x}\\frac{x}{5000050000} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{5000050000}\\sum_{x=1}^{100000} 1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{100000}{5000050000} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{100001}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThese functions applied to random variables are often thought of as “transformations” of the random quantities. For instance, we transformed a side length into a volume. While the law of the unconscious statistician will apply to any transformation for a random variable, we can sometimes use shortcuts to circumvent its application. In particular, when \\(g(X) = aX + b\\), for constant numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we can greatly simplify the expected value of the transformation. To see this note \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[aX + b] &= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}(ax + b)p_X(x) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}axp_X(x) + bp_X(x) \\\\\n&= a\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) + b\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}p_X(X) \\\\\n&= aE[X] + b.\n\\end{align*}\\] That is, in general, we have that \\(E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b\\). Note that part of the property of the linearity of expectation that we can immediately see if that the expected value of any constant is always that constant. If we take \\(a = 0\\), then we see that \\(E[aX + b] = E[b] = b\\). Thus, any time that we need to take the expected value of any constant number, we know that it is just that number.\nThis is particularly useful as linear transformations like \\(aX+b\\) arise very commonly. For instance, most unit conversions are simple linear combinations. If a random quantity is measured in one unit then this result can be used to quickly convert expectations to another.\n\nExample 6.8 (Sadie’s Trip to America) Sadie has recently returned from a long trip to America. The trip was long enough that temperatures measured in Fahrenheit started to make sense. When Sadie and Charles begin to talk about the weather, Charles brings up the temperature distribution of a possible summer vacation spot. Unfortunately for Sadie, these temperatures are all in Celsius. The distribution Charles provides is \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases}\n    0.1 & x \\in \\{10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\} \\\\\n    0.05 & x \\in \\{15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\\} \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\nWhat is the expected temperature, in Celsius?\nSupposing that the temperature in Fahrenheit is given by \\(Y = 1.8X + 32\\), what is the expected temperature in Fahrenheit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we find \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{x=10}^{24} xp_X(x) &= 0.1\\sum_{x=10}^{14}x + 0.05\\sum_{x=15}^{24}x \\\\\n&= 15.75.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSince \\(E[X] = 15.75\\) then \\(E[Y] = E[1.8X + 32] = 1.8E[X] + 32 = 60.35\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis type of linear transformation also frequently comes up with games of chance and payouts, or with scoring more generally.10 Beyond being linear over simple transformations, summations in general behave nicely with expectations. Specifically, for any quantities separated by addition, say \\(g(X) + h(X)\\), the expected value will be the sum of each expected value. Formally, \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[g(X) + h(X)] &= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} (g(x) + h(x))p_X(x) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} g(x)p_X(x) + h(x)p_X(x) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} g(x)p_X(x) + \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} h(x)p_X(x) \\\\\n&= E[g(X)] + E[h(X)].\n\\end{align*}\\]\nBehaving well under linearity is one of the very nice properties of expectations. It will come in useful when dealing with a large variety of important quantities, and as we will see shortly, this linearity will also extend to multiple different random quantities.\nMeasures of central tendency are important to summarize the behaviour of a random quantity. Whether using the mean, median, or mode, these measures of location describe, on average, what to expect from observations of the random quantity. However, understanding a distribution requires understanding far more than simply the measures of location. As was discussed previously, the probability mass function captures the complete probabilistic behaviour of a discrete random variable, it is only intuitive that some information would be lost with a single numeric summary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEqual Location Across Different Distributions\n\n\n\nConsider the following three distributions for three random variables, \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\): \\[\\begin{align*}\np_X(x) = \\begin{cases}\n    0.25 & x = -1 \\\\\n    0.5 & x = 0 \\\\\n    0.25 & x = 1 \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases} \\quad\np_Y(y) &= \\begin{cases}\n    0.05 & x = -5 \\\\\n    0.1 & x = -4 \\\\\n    0.1 & x = -3 \\\\\n    0.1 & x = -2\\\\\n    0.1 & x = -1\\\\\n    0.15 & x = 0 \\\\\n    0.1 & x = 1\\\\\n    0.1 & x = 2\\\\\n    0.1 & x = 3\\\\\n    0.1 & x = 4 \\\\\n    0.05 & x = 5 \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases} \\quad\np_Z(z) = \\begin{cases}\n    0.25 & x = -400 \\\\\n    0.5 & x = 0 \\\\\n    \\frac{1}{3196} & x \\in \\{1,\\dots,799\\}\\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIn each of these distributions we have the mean, median, and mode all equalling \\(0\\).11 However, even just from a quick glance, these distributions are all very, very differently behaved. The location summaries here clearly miss much of the important information about these different distributions. Spend some time trying to think of the ways in which they differ from one another, and see if you can determine what is missing from relying solely on measures of location.",

    "text": "6.5 Summarizing the Variability of a Random Variable\nA key characteristic of the behaviour of a random variable which is not captured by the measures of location is the variability of the quantity. If we imagine taking repeated realizations of a random variable, the variability of the random variable captures how much movement there will be observation to observation. If a random variable has low variability, we expect that the various observations will cluster together, becoming not too distant from one another. If a random variable has high variability, we expect the observations to jump around each time.\n\n6.5.1 The Range\nJust as was the case with measures of location, there are several measures of variability which may be applicable in any given setting. One fairly basic measure of this variability is the range of possible values: what is the highest possible value, what is the lowest possible value, and how much distance is there between those two points?\n\nDefinition 6.5 (Range) For a random variable, \\(X\\), the range of the random variable is defined as \\(\\text{Range}(X) = \\max(X) - \\min(X)\\). That is, it is the distance between the maximum value that the random variable can take on, and the minimum value that the random variable can take on. Sometimes the range is reported with these outpoints explicitly specified.\n\nThis is a fairly intuitive notion, and is particularly useful in the equal probability model over a sequence of numbers. Consider dice. Dice are typically defined by the range of values that they occupy, say \\(1\\) to \\(6\\), or \\(1\\) to \\(20\\). Once you know the values present on any die, you have a sense for how much the values can move observation to observation.\n\nExample 6.9 (Charles and Sadie Explore Ice Cream Flavors) Charles and Sadie have decided to spend their sunny afternoon exploring various ice cream flavors at their local parlor, Symmetric Scoops. They notice that Scoops Galore offers a wide variety of flavors, from classic vanilla to exotic dragon fruit swirl. Intrigued by the selection, they decide to investigate the probability distribution of a random variable, \\(Y\\), representing the number of unique flavors a customer selects.\nAfter discreetly observing several customers, Charles and Sadie jot down their findings: \\[\np_Y(y) = \\begin{cases}\n0.2 & y = 1 \\\\\n0.35 & y = 2 \\\\\n0.3 & y = 3 \\\\\n0.15 & y = 4 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWhat is the range of the random variable \\(Y\\), representing the number of unique ice cream flavors a customer selects at Scoops Galore?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the defining relationship for this random variable, we can see that the maximum value the distribution can take on is \\(4\\) (with probability \\(0.15\\)) and the minimum value is \\(1\\) (with probability \\(0.2\\)). As a result, we say that \\(\\text{Range}(Y) = 4 - 1 = 3\\).\n\n\n\n\nWhile the range is an important measure to consider to determine the behaviour of a random variable, it is a fairly crude measurement. It may be the case that, while the extreme values are possible, they are sufficiently unlikely so as to come up very infrequently and not remain representative of the likely spread of observations. Alternatively, many random variables have a theoretically infinite range. In these cases, providing the range will likely not provide much utility.\n\nExample 6.10 (Charles and Sadie Explore Ice Cream Flavors, Again) Having had so much fun at Symmetric Scoops the first time, Charles and Sadie return once more to continue to investigate customers behaviour. When they arrive they notice a temporary promotion going on, which happens on one randomly selected Sunday a year, where customers can buy a Mega Sunda(y)e Extravaganza, a wonderfully extravagant creation that features scoops from all \\(50\\) flavours on offer. Working on this today they find the following probability mass function for \\(Y\\). \\[\np_Y(y) = \\begin{cases}\n0.2 & y = 1 \\\\\n0.35 & y = 2 \\\\\n0.3 & y = 3 \\\\\n0.145 & y = 4 \\\\\n0.005 & y = 50 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWhat is the range of the random variable \\(Y\\) now? Does this accurately represent the dispersion we expect from \\(Y\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the defining relationship for this random variable, we can see that the maximum value the distribution can take on is \\(50\\) (with probability \\(0.005\\)) and the minimum value is \\(1\\) (with probability \\(0.2\\)). As a result, we say that \\(\\text{Range}(Y) = 50 - 1 = 49\\). This does not accurately represent the dispersion of the random variable. Not only do very few customers order this when it is available, it is also almost never available. As a result, the maximum value (while possible) is not reflective of the usual behaviour of this random quantity, and this displays one of the concerns with the range as a measure of spread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.2 The Interquartile Range\nTo remedy these two issues, we may think of techniques to modify the range. Instead of taking the minimum and maximum possible values, we can instead consider ranges of values which remain more plausible. A common way to do this is to extend our concept of a median beyond the half-way point. The median of a random variable \\(X\\), is the value, \\(m\\), such that \\(P(X \\leq m) = 0.5\\)12. While there is good reason to care about the midpoint, we can think of generalizing this to be any probability.\nThat is, we could find a number \\(z\\), such that \\(P(X \\leq z) = 0.1\\). We could then use this value to conclude that the probability of observing a value less than \\(z\\) is \\(10\\%\\). These values are referred to, generally, as percentiles and they are the natural extension of medians.\n\nDefinition 6.6 (Percentiles) The \\(100p\\)th percentile (e.g., \\(70\\)th percentile for \\(p=0.7\\), or \\(20\\)th percentile for \\(p=0.20\\)), is denoted \\(\\zeta(p)\\) and is the value such that \\(P(X \\leq \\zeta(p)) = p\\). Thus, the median is given by \\(\\zeta(0.5)\\) and is also called the \\(50\\)th percentile.13\n\n\nExample 6.11 (Perplexed at the Ice Cream Parlour) Charles and Sadie remained somewhat disappointed by their lack of ability to accurately capture the behaviour of a random variable using the range. To this end, they spend a lot more time at the ice cream parlor, and come up with, what they believe, is the correct probability mass function for how many flavours customers order, in total. \\[\np_Y(y) = \\begin{cases}\n    0.25 & y = 1 \\\\\n    0.25 & y = 2 \\\\\n    0.1 & y = 3 \\\\\n    0.05 & y = 4 \\\\\n    0.05 & y = 5 \\\\\n    0.05 & y = 6 \\\\\n    0.15 & y = 7 \\\\\n    0.05 & y = 8 \\\\\n    0.04 & y = 9 \\\\\n    0.005 & y = 10 \\\\\n    0.005 & y = 50 \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nUsing this probability mass function, find \\(\\zeta(0.25)\\), \\(\\zeta(0.5)\\), \\(\\zeta(0.75)\\), and \\(\\zeta(0.99)\\). What do each of these values mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\zeta(0.25)\\) is found by looking for \\(P(Y \\leq \\zeta(0.25)) = 0.25\\). We note that \\(P(Y \\leq 1) = P(Y = 1) = 0.25\\), and so \\(\\zeta(0.25) = 1\\). This means that there is a \\(25\\%\\) chance that a randomly selected individual will order \\(1\\) or fewer flavours.\n\\(\\zeta(0.5)\\) is found by looking for \\(P(Y \\leq \\zeta(0.5)) = 0.25\\). Note that \\(P(Y \\leq 2) = P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2) = 0.5\\), and so \\(\\zeta(0.5) = 2\\). This means that \\(50\\%\\) of customers order \\(2\\) or fewer flavours, and \\(50\\%\\) of customers order more than \\(2\\) flavours.\n\\(\\zeta(0.75)\\) is found by looking for \\(P(Y \\leq \\zeta(0.75)) = 0.75\\). Note that we can continue the cumulative sums from the probability mass function. This gives, in order, \\(0.25, 0.5, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 0.995, 1\\). As a result, \\(P(Y \\leq 6) = 0.75\\) and so \\(\\zeta(0.75) = 6\\). This means that \\(75\\%\\) of customers order \\(7\\) or fewer flavours (the remaining \\(25\\%\\) order more than \\(7\\)).\n\\(\\zeta(0.99)\\) can be found through the same cumulative sums as in (c). This is given by \\(y = 9\\), such that \\(P(Y \\leq 9) = 0.99\\), so \\(\\zeta(0.99) = 9\\). This means that \\(99\\%\\) of individuals order \\(9\\) or fewer flavours.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can leverage percentiles to remedy some of the issues with the range as a measure of variability. Framed in terms of percentiles, the minimum value is \\(\\zeta(0)\\), and the maximum value is \\(\\zeta(1)\\). Instead of considering the extreme endpoints, we can consider the difference between more moderate percentiles. Doing so allows us to overcome the major concerns outlined with the range. If we take \\(\\zeta(p_1)\\) and \\(\\zeta(p_2)\\), for \\(p_1 &lt; p_2\\), then the difference between \\(\\zeta(p_2) - \\zeta(p_1)\\) can be seen as a measure of variability, analogous to the range.\nThe most common choices would be to take \\(\\zeta(0.25)\\) and \\(\\zeta(0.75)\\), the \\(25\\)th and \\(75\\)th percentiles, respectively. These are also referred to as the first and third quartiles, respectively. They are named as, taking \\(\\zeta(0.25)\\), \\(\\zeta(0.5)\\) and \\(\\zeta(0.75)\\), the distribution is cut into quarters.\nWith the first and third quartiles computed, we can compute the interquartile range, which is given by \\(\\zeta(0.75)-\\zeta(0.25)\\).\n\nDefinition 6.7 (Interquartile Range (IQR)) The interquartile range, or IQR, is defined as \\(\\zeta(0.75) - \\zeta(0.25)\\), the difference between the third and first quartiles. It is a measure of spread, and is typically denoted as \\(\\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1\\), where \\(Q\\) stands for quartiles.\n\nLike the range, the IQR gives a measure of how much spread there tends to be in a distribution. Unlike the range, however, we can be more certain that both the first and third quartiles are reasonable values around which repeated observations of the random variable would be observed. Specifically, there is a probability of \\(0.5\\) that a value between the first and third quartile will be observed. The larger the \\(\\text{IQR}\\), the more spread out these moderate observations will be, and as a result, the more variable the distribution is.\n\nExample 6.12 (Addressing the Ice Cream Perplexity) Having understood many of the percentiles of the distribution of ice cream flavours ordered at Symmetric Scoops, Charles and Sadie decide to have another shot at capturing the spread. Recall that the probability mass function for \\(Y\\), the number of ice cream flavours ordered by a customer, is given by \\[\np_Y(y) = \\begin{cases}\n0.25 & y = 1 \\\\\n0.25 & y = 2 \\\\\n0.1 & y = 3 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 4 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 5 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 6 \\\\\n0.15 & y = 7 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 8 \\\\\n0.04 & y = 9 \\\\\n0.005 & y = 10 \\\\\n0.005 & y = 50 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWhat is the interquartile range for this population? How does this compare to the range?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that \\(\\zeta(0.25) = 1\\) and \\(\\zeta(0.75) = 6\\). As a result, the \\(\\text{IQR} = 6 - 1 = 5\\). By contrast, the range is given by \\(50 - 1 = 49\\). It is incredibly rare to observe a customer ordering \\(50\\) flavours, as a result, using \\(5\\) is a better measure of spread of the distribution. To see this, we could consider plotting a histogram (more on these later on) that show the number of customers who order each type, and then intuitively as for a good measure of how spread out the data are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.3 The Variance and Mean Absolute Deviation\nBoth the range and the interquartile range give a sense of the variation in the distribution irrespective of the measures of location for that distribution. Another plausible method for assessing the variability of a distribution is to assess how far we expect observations to be from its center. Intuitively, if observations of \\(X\\) are near the center with high probability, then the distribution will be less variable than if the average distance to the center is larger.\nThis intuitive measure of variability is useful for capturing the behaviour of a random variable, particularly when paired with a measure of location. However, we do have to be careful: not all measures of dispersion based on this notion will be useful. Consider the most basic possibility, \\(X - E[X]\\). We might ask, for instance, what is the expected value of this quantity. If we take \\(E[X - E[X]]\\) then note that this a linear combination in expectation since \\(E[X]\\) is just some number. Thus, \\(E[X-E[X]] = E[X] - E[X] = 0\\). In other words, the expected difference between a random variable and its mean is exactly \\(0\\). We thus need to think harder about how best to turn this intuition into a useful measure of spread.\nThe issue with this procedure is that some realizations are going to be below the mean, making the difference negative, and some will be above the mean, making the difference positive. Our defining relationship for the mean relied on balancing these two sets of mass. However, when discussing the variability of the random variable, we do not much care whether the observations are lower than expected or higher than expected, we simply care how much variability there is around what is expected. To remedy this, we should consider only the distance between the observation and the expectation, not the sign. That is, if \\(X\\) is \\(5\\) below \\(E[X]\\) we should treat that the same as if \\(X\\) is \\(5\\) above \\(E[X]\\).\nThere are two common ways to turn value into its magnitude in mathematics generally: squaring the number and using absolute values. Both of these tactics are useful approaches to defining measures of spread, and they result in the variance when using the expected value of the squared deviations, and the mean absolute deviation when using the absolute value. While \\(E[|X-E[X]|]\\) is perhaps the more intuitive quantity to consider, generally speaking it will not be the one that we use.\n\nDefinition 6.8 (Variance) The variance of a random variable, typically denoted \\(\\text{var}(X)\\), is given by the expected value of the squared deviations of a random variable from its mean. That is, \\[\\text{var}(X) = E\\left[(X - E[X])^2\\right].\\]\n\n\nDefinition 6.9 (Mean Absolute Deviation) The mean absolute deviation of a random variable, typically denoted \\(\\text{MAD}(X)\\), is given by the expected value of the absolute value of the deviations of a random variable from its mean. That is, \\[\\text{MAD}(X) = E\\left[|X - E[X]|\\right].\\]\n\nIn general when we need a positive quantity in mathematics it will typically be preferable to consider the square to the absolute value.14 The variance is the central measure of deviation for random variables. When discussing the variability of a random variable, it will almost universally be in reference to the variance.\nNote that if we take \\(g(X) = (X-E[X])^2\\), then the variance of \\(X\\) is the expected value of a transformation. We have seen that to compute these we apply the law of the unconscious statistician, and substitute \\(g(X)\\) into the defining relationship for the expected value, which for the variance gives \\[\\text{var}(X) = \\sum_{x\\in\\in\\mathcal{X}} (x-E[X])^2p_X(x).\\] In order to compute the variance, we must also find the mean as the function \\(g(X)\\) relies upon this value.\n\nExample 6.13 (Variation in the Number of Ice Cream Flavours Ordered) Noting how different the range and IQR were of the distribution of number of different flavours ordered by customers at the ice cream parlour, Charles and Sadie decide to turn to the variance and mean absolute deviation to try understand the distribution’s variability once-and-for-all. Recall that the probability mass function for \\(Y\\), the number of ice cream flavours ordered by a customer, is given by \\[\np_Y(y) = \\begin{cases}\n0.25 & y = 1 \\\\\n0.25 & y = 2 \\\\\n0.1 & y = 3 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 4 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 5 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 6 \\\\\n0.15 & y = 7 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 8 \\\\\n0.04 & y = 9 \\\\\n0.005 & y = 10 \\\\\n0.005 & y = 50 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nFind the variance and the mean absolute variation for this distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFor both \\(\\text{var}(Y)\\) and \\(\\text{MAD}(Y)\\) we require the expected value of \\(Y\\). To this end note that \\[\\begin{multline*}E[Y] = (0.25)(1) + (0.25)(2) + (0.1)(3) + (0.05)(4) + (0.05)(5) + (0.05)(6) + (0.15)(7) \\\\ + (0.05)(8) + (0.04)(9) + (0.005)(10) + (0.005)(50) = 3.91.\\end{multline*}\\]\nThen, it can be useful to define a table with the probabilities, absolute, and squared deviations, so that the summations can be made easier.\n\n\n\n\\(Y\\)\n\\(p_Y(y)\\)\n\\((Y - E[Y])^2\\)\n\\(|Y - E[Y]|\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\\(0.25\\)\n\\(8.4681\\)\n\\(2.91\\)\n\n\n\\(2\\)\n\\(0.25\\)\n\\(3.6481\\)\n\\(1.91\\)\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\\(0.1\\)\n\\(0.8281\\)\n\\(0.91\\)\n\n\n\\(4\\)\n\\(0.05\\)\n\\(0.0081\\)\n\\(0.09\\)\n\n\n\\(5\\)\n\\(0.05\\)\n\\(1.1881\\)\n\\(1.09\\)\n\n\n\\(6\\)\n\\(0.05\\)\n\\(4.3681\\)\n\\(2.09\\)\n\n\n\\(7\\)\n\\(0.15\\)\n\\(9.5481\\)\n\\(3.09\\)\n\n\n\\(8\\)\n\\(0.05\\)\n\\(16.7281\\)\n\\(4.09\\)\n\n\n\\(9\\)\n\\(0.04\\)\n\\(25.9081\\)\n\\(5.09\\)\n\n\n\\(10\\)\n\\(0.005\\)\n\\(37.0881\\)\n\\(6.09\\)\n\n\n\\(50\\)\n\\(0.005\\)\n\\(2124.2881\\)\n\\(46.09\\)\n\n\n\nWith this table we can compute both the variance and mean absolute deviation by taking the second column times by the third, and adding up those results (for the variance) and the second column times the fourth, and adding up those results (for the MAD). Doing so results in \\(\\text{var}(Y) = 17.5019\\) and \\(\\text{MAD}(Y) = 2.592\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.4 Standard Deviation\nThe higher that an individual random variable’s variance is, the more spread we expect there to be in repeated realizations of that quantity. Specifically, the more spread out around the mean value the random variable will be. A random variable with a low variance will concentrate more around its mean value than one with a higher variance. One confusing part of the variance of a random variable is in trying to assess the units. Suppose that a random quantity is measured in a particular set of units – dollars, seconds, grams, or similar. In this case, our interpretations of measures of location will all be in the same units, which aids in drawing connections to the underlying phenomenon that we are trying to study. However, because the variance is squared, we cannot make the same extensions to it. Variance is not measured in the regular units, but in the regular units, squared.\nSuppose you have a random time being measured, perhaps the reaction time for some treatment to take effect in a treated patient. Finding the mean or median will give you a result that you can read off in seconds. The range and interquartile range both give you the spread in seconds. However, if you work out the variance of this quantity it will be measured in seconds squared – a unit that is challenging to have much intuition about. To remedy this we will often use a transformed version of the variance, called the standard deviation, returning the units to be only the original scale.\n\nDefinition 6.10 (Standard Deviation) The standard deviation of a random variable is the square root of the variance, which is to say \\[\\text{SD}(X) = \\sqrt{\\text{var}(X)}.\\]\n\nWe do not often consider computing the standard deviation directly, and so will most commonly refer to the variance when discussing the behaviour of a random variable, but it is important to be able to move seamlessly between these two measures of spread.\n\nExample 6.14 (Variation in the Number of Ice Cream Flavours Ordered, the Finale) Having realized that the IQR and range are not directly comparable to the variance, as they are measured in different units, Charles and Sadie decide to end their investigation in the variability of the number of ice cream flavours ordered by calculating the standard deviation of \\(Y\\). Recall that the probability mass function for \\(Y\\), the number of ice cream flavours ordered by a customer, is given by \\[\np_Y(y) = \\begin{cases}\n0.25 & y = 1 \\\\\n0.25 & y = 2 \\\\\n0.1 & y = 3 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 4 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 5 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 6 \\\\\n0.15 & y = 7 \\\\\n0.05 & y = 8 \\\\\n0.04 & y = 9 \\\\\n0.005 & y = 10 \\\\\n0.005 & y = 50 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}.\n\\]\nWhat is the standard deviation of this random variable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard deviation is given by the square root of the variance. This is given by \\(\\sqrt{17.5019} = 4.18353\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.15 (The Dolphin Olympics) Sadie and Charles, on a trip to a beach in a particularly quirky town, find themselves watching the dolphin Olympics. These are a set of games put on by the local dolphin populations where they see how high they can jump from the water, and how many flips they can do while they do it. Charles and Sadie get to work determining the probability distributions related to the heights and the number of flips, with Sadie taking the heights and Charles taking the number of flips. At the end of the day they are discussing their findings and Sadie indicates that the standard deviation of the height that was jumped was \\(1.6m\\). Charles is intrigued, saying, “I could have sworn that there was more variation in the jump heights than in the number of flips, but the variance of the flips was \\(2.56\\), greater than the variability in the heights!”\nIs Charles correct? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles has compared the standard deviation of the first quantity to the variance of the second. We must compare the same measure, and as a result, conclude that the variance of the heights was \\(1.6^2 = 2.56\\), exactly the same as the second.",

    "text": "6.6 Computing the Variance\nWhen computing the variance of a random quantity, we often use a shortcut for the formula, \\[\\text{var}(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2.\\] Generally, this is moderately more straightforward to calculate since \\(X^2\\) is an easier transformation than \\((X-E[X])^2\\). This identity will come back time and time again, with a lot of versatility in the ways that it can be used. Typically, when a variance is needed to be calculated the process is to simply compute \\(E[X]\\) and \\(E[X^2]\\), and then apply this relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof of the Variance Identity\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the variance identity, we need only remember the definition of the variance (being \\(E[(X-E[X])^2]\\)), and then use summation techniques to manipulate the expression. To this end consider, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\text{var}(X) &= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} (x-E[X])^2p_X(x) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} (x^2 - 2xE[X] + E[X]^2)p_X(x) \\\\\n&=\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} x^2p_X(x) - 2E[X]\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) + E[X^2]\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}p_X(x)\\\\\n&= E[X^2] - 2E[X]E[X] + E[X]^2\\\\\n&= E[X^2] - E[X]^2.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.16 (Choosing the Outcome of a Die) Charles and Sadie come across a new game of chance involving the rolling of a die. In it a player chooses a number between \\(1\\) and \\(6\\). They then roll a die (up to) \\(6\\) times. If they get their chosen number on the first throw for the first time, they get \\(\\$1\\). If they get their chosen number on the second throw, they get \\(\\$2\\). The same goes for the first time seeing their chosen number from throws \\(3\\) through \\(6\\). If they never get the chosen number, they have to pay \\(\\$1\\).\nWhat is the expected value and variance of a player playing this game?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(X\\) represent the winnings of a play of this game. We know that \\(X\\) takes a value in \\(\\{-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). The \\(p_X(-1)\\) is given by the probability that the die never shows the chosen number. We can view this as \\(6\\) independent trials, where each trial is the result of a die roll. If \\(A_j\\) is the event that the die shows the selected number, then we can calculate \\(P(A_1^C, A_2^C, A_3^C, A_4^C, A_5^C, A_6^C) = P(A_1^C)P(A_2^C)P(A_3^C)P(A_4^C)P(A_5^C)P(A_6^C)\\). Note that each of these probabilities is equivalent, and equivalently equal to \\(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\), and so this probability is \\(\\left(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^6 \\approx 0.335\\). The remainder of the outcomes happen if the first time that the number shows up is on toss \\(j\\). This means that we have \\(A_1, \\dots, A_{j-1}^C\\) and then \\(A_j\\) occurring. As a result, for \\(j=1,\\dots,6\\) we get \\(P(A_1^C, \\dots, A_{j-1}^C, A_j) = P(A_1^C)^{j-1}P(A_j)\\). Note that \\(P(A_j) = \\dfrac{1}{6}\\), no matter \\(j\\), and so the total probability here is \\(\\left(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^{j-1}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)\\). This fully defines the probability mass function.\nTo get the \\(E[X]\\) we can apply the standard expectation formula. To get the variance we can note that \\(\\text{var}(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2\\), and so while we compute \\(E[X]\\) we can also compute \\(E[X^2]\\). To this end \\[E[X] = (-1)\\left(\\frac{5}{5}\\right)^6 + \\frac{1}{6}\\left[1 + 2\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) + 3\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{2} + 4\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{3} + 5\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{4}+ 6\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{5}\\right].\\] Solving this gives approximately \\(\\$0.98\\), so every play of the game you would expect to earn \\(98\\) cents, approximately. To find \\(E[X^2]\\), we use essentially the same setup, this time squaring the values, \\[E[X] = (-1)^2\\left(\\frac{5}{5}\\right)^6 + \\frac{1}{6}\\left[1^2 + 2^2\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) + 3^2\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{2} + 4^2\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{3} + 5^2\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{4}+ 6^2\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{5}\\right].\\] This is \\(8.728\\), approximately. Then the variance will be given by \\[\\text{var}(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 \\approx 8.728 - (0.98)^2 = 7.7676.\\]",

    "section": "6.7 The Variance of Transformations",
    "text": "6.7 The Variance of Transformations\nWith expectations, we saw that \\(E[g(X)]\\) needed to be directly computed from the definition. The same is true for variances of transformations. Specifically, \\(\\text{var}(g(X))\\) is given by \\(E[(g(X) - E[g(X)])^2]\\) which can be simplified with the previous relationship as \\(E[g(X)^2] - E[g(X)]^2\\). Just as with expectations, it is important to realize that \\(\\text{var}(g(X)) \\neq g(\\text{var}(X))\\), and so dealing with transformations requires further work.\nWith expectations, we highlighted linear transformations as a special case, with \\(g(X) = aX + b\\). For the variance, the linear transformations are also worth distinguishing from others. In particular, \\[\\text{var}(aX + b) = a^2\\text{var}(X).\\] In the same way that the linearity of expectation demonstrates that the expected value of any constant is that constant, we can use this identity to show that the variance of constant is zero. However, we can also reason to this based on our definitions so far. Suppose that we have a random variable which is constant.15 A constant \\(b\\) can be seen as a random variable with probability distribution \\(p_X(x) = 1\\) if \\(x=b\\) and \\(p_X(x) = 0\\) otherwise. The expected value is going to be \\(E[X] = 1(b) = b\\), and \\(E[X^2] = 1(b)^2 = b^2\\). Thus, \\(\\text{var}(b) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 = b^2 - b^2 = 0\\). From an intuitive perspective, there is no variation around the mean of a constant. It is always the same value. As a result, when taking the variance, we know that it should be \\(0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof of the Variance of Linear Transformations\n\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate the variance of a linear transformation of a random variable we can apply the standard identity for the variance, giving \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[(aX+b)^2] &= E[a^2X^2 + 2abX + b^2] \\\\\n&= E[a^2X^2] + E[2abX] + E[b^2]\\\\\n&= a^2E[X^2] + 2abE[X] + b^2.\n\\end{align*}\\] Next, we note that \\(E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[aX + b]^2 &= (aE[X] + b)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2E[X]^2 + 2abE[X] + b^2.\\end{align*}\\] Differencing these two quantities gives \\[a^2E[X^2] + 2abE[X] + b^2 - a^2E[X]^2 - 2abE[X] - b^2 = a^2(E[X^2] - E[X]^2).\\] By noting that \\(E[X^2] - E[X]^2\\), we can complete the statement that \\[\\text{var}(aX + b) = a^2\\text{var}(X).\\]\n\n\n\nThus, when applying a linear transformation, only the multiplicative constant matters, and it transforms the variance by a squared factor. This should make some intuitive sense that the additive constant does not change anything. If we consider that variance is a measure of spread, adding a constant value to our random quantity will not make it more or less spread out, it will simply shift where the spread is located. This is not true of the mean, which measures where the center of the distribution is, which helps explain why the result identities are different.\n\nExample 6.17 (Sadie’s Trip to America) When Sadie had recently returned from a long trip to America, Charles and Sadie worked out how to convert the expected values of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. They now wish to do the same, with the variances. The distribution of daily temperatures, in Celsius, is \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases}\n    0.1 & x \\in \\{10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\} \\\\\n    0.05 & x \\in \\{15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\\} \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\nWhat is the variance of temperatures, in Celsius?\nSupposing that the temperature in Fahrenheit is given by \\(Y = 1.8X + 32\\), what is the variance of temperatures in Fahrenheit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we find \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X] = \\sum_{x=10}^{24} xp_X(x) &= 0.1\\sum_{x=10}^{14}x + 0.05\\sum_{x=15}^{24}x \\\\\n&= 15.75. \\\\\nE[X^2] = \\sum_{x=10}^{24} x^2p_X(x) &= 0.1\\sum_{x=10}^{14}x^2 + 0.05\\sum_{x=15}^{24}x^2 \\\\\n&= 267.25 \\\\\n\\text{var}(X) &= 267.25 - 15.75^2 \\\\\n&= 19.1875.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSince \\(\\text{var}(X) = 19.1875\\), then we know that \\(\\text{var}(Y) = \\text{var}(1.8X + 32) = 1.8^2\\text{var}(X) = 62.1675\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the expectation, the variance of additive terms will not generally be the addition of the variances themselves. That is, we cannot say that \\(\\text{var}(g(X) + h(X)) = \\text{var}(g(X)) + \\text{var}(h(X))\\). Writing out the definition shows issue with this, \\[E[(g(X) + h(X))^2] = E[g(X)^2] + 2E[g(X)h(X)] + E[h(X)^2].\\] The first and third terms here are nicely separated and behave well. However, the central term is not generally easy to simplify. You can view \\(g(X)h(X)\\) as a function itself, and so \\[E[g(X)h(X)] \\neq E[g(X)]E[h(X)].\\] Instead, this will typically need to be worked out for any specific set of functions.",

    "text": "7.1 Conditional Expectation\nUp until this point we have considered the marginal probability distribution when exploring the measures of central tendency and spread. These help to summarize the marginal behaviour of a random quantity, capturing the distribution of \\(X\\) alone. When introducing distributions, we also made a point to introduce the conditional distribution as one which is particularly relevant when there is extra information. The question “what do we expect to happen, given that we have an additional piece of information?” is not only well-defined, but it is an incredibly common type of question to ask.1 To answer it, we require conditional expectations.\nIn principle, a conditional expectation is no more challenging to calculate than a marginal expectation. Suppose we want to know the expected value of \\(X\\) assuming that we know that a second random quantity, \\(Y\\) has taken on the value \\(y\\). We write this as \\(E[X|Y=y]\\), and we replace \\(p_X(x)\\) with \\(p_{X|Y}(x|y)\\) in the defining relationship. That is \\[E[X|Y=y] = \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}xp_{X|Y}(x|y).\\] We can think of the conditional distribution of \\(X|Y=y\\) as simply being a distribution itself, and then work with that no differently. The conditional variance, which we denote \\(\\text{var}(X|Y=y)\\) is defined in an exactly analogous manner, giving \\[\\text{var}(X|Y) = E[(X - E[X|Y])^2|Y].\\]\nAbove we supposed that we knew that \\(Y=y\\). However, sometimes we want to work with the conditional distribution more generally. That is, we want to investigate the behaviour of \\(X|Y\\), without yet knowing what \\(Y\\) equals. We can use the same procedure as above, however, this time we leave \\(Y\\) unspecified. We denote this as \\(E[X|Y]\\), and this expression will be a function of \\(Y\\). Then, whenever a value for \\(Y\\) is observed, we can specify \\(Y=y\\), deriving the specific value. We will typically compute \\(E[X|Y]\\) rather than \\(E[X|Y=y]\\), since once we have \\(E[X|Y]\\) we can easily find \\(E[X|Y=y]\\) for every value of \\(y\\).",

Specifically, we write \\(E[X|Y]\\), and define this to be \\[E[X|Y] = \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} xp_{X|Y}(x|y),\\] which is exactly analogous to the defining relationship for \\(E[X]\\), replacing the marginal probability mass function with the conditional probability mass function.\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.1 (Charles Commences Crocheting) Charles has recently taking up crocheting, but as it is a new skill, is still in the phase of learning where mistakes are somewhat common. When sitting down to practice, the number of rows that Charles can complete in an hour is being recorded by Sadie, as a random quantity \\(X\\). After these have been completed, Charles goes back through and counts the number of mistakes that were made, recording this as \\(Y\\). In their experiments they find that \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\frac{44800}{854769} \\frac{1}{(x-y)!y!} \\left(\\frac{21}{10}\\right)^x\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^{y}, \\] for \\(x \\in \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}\\) and \\(y \\in\\{0,1,2,\\dots,y\\}\\).

For this, we can use \\(p_{Y|X}(y|3)\\) as the distribution, which is expressible as \\[p_{Y|X}(y|3) = \\frac{\\frac{44800}{854769} \\frac{1}{(3-y)!y!} \\left(\\frac{21}{10}\\right)^3\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^{y}}{\\frac{44800}{854769} \\frac{3^{3}}{(3)!}} = \\left(\\frac{7}{10}\\right)^3\\binom{3}{y}\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^y,\\] where \\(y \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}\\).

This is often a confusing concept when it is first introduced, so to recap:\n\n\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are both random variables;\n\\(E[X]\\) and \\(E[Y]\\) are both constant, numerical values describing the distribution of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\);\n\\(E[X|Y=y]\\) and \\(E[Y|X=x]\\) are each numeric constants which summarize the distribution of \\(X|Y=y\\) and \\(Y|X=x\\) respectively;\n\\(E[X|Y]\\) and \\(E[Y|X]\\) are functions of \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\), respectively, and can as such be seen as transformations of (and random quantities depending on) \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) respectively.\n\nWe do not often think of the distribution of \\(E[X|Y]\\) directly, however, there are very useful results regarding its expected value and its variance, which will commonly be exploited. If we take the expected value of \\(E[X|Y]\\) we will find that \\(E[E[X|Y]] = E[X]\\). Note that since \\(E[X|Y] = g(Y)\\) for some transformation, \\(g\\), the outer expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of \\(Y\\). Sometimes when this may get confusing we will use notation to emphasize this fact, specifically, \\(E_Y[E_{X|Y}[X|Y]] = E_X[X]\\). This notation is not necessary, but it can clarify when there is much going on, and is a useful technique to fallback on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Law of Total Expectation\n\n\n\nFor any random quantities, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the Law of Total Expectation states that \\[E[X] = E[E[X|Y]].\\] That is, if we first compute the conditional expectation of \\(X\\) given \\(Y\\), then take the expected value of this quantity, we compute \\(E[X]\\).\n\n\nIn the same way that it is sometimes easier to first condition on \\(Y\\) in order to compute the marginal distribution of \\(X\\) via applications of the law of total probability, so too can it be easier to first work out conditional expectations, and then take the expected value of the resulting expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof of the Law of Total Expectation\n\n\n\n\n\nTo prove that law of total expectation, we note that \\(E[X|Y]\\) is a random function of \\(Y\\). As a result, we can apply the LOTUS to \\(E[X|Y]\\) as a function of \\(Y\\) when we take \\(E[E[X|Y]]\\). Doing so yields, \\[\\begin{align*}\nE_Y[E[X|Y]] &= \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}} E[X|Y]p_Y(y) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\left(\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}xp_{X|Y}(x|Y)\\right)p_Y(y) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}x\\frac{p_{X,Y}(x,y)}{p_Y(y)}p_Y(y)\\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}xp_{X,Y}(x,y)\\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} xp_X(x)\\\\\n&= E[X].\\end{align*}\\] The remainder of the proof, following an application of the LOTUS relies upon manipulating summations.\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.2 (Charles Crochet Mistakes) While Charles came to understand the expected number of mistakes being made given a certain number of crochet lines being complete, it is easier for Charles to consider this on the basis of hourly errors than conditional hourly errors. Knowing that \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\frac{44800}{854769} \\frac{1}{(x-y)!y!} \\left(\\frac{21}{10}\\right)^x\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^{y}, \\] for \\(x \\in \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}\\) and \\(y \\in\\{0,1,2,\\dots,y\\}\\), that \\[p_X(x) = \\frac{44800}{854769} \\frac{3^x}{x!}, \\quad x\\in\\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\},\\] and that \\(E[Y|X] = \\frac{3X}{10}\\), what is \\(E[Y]\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can apply the law of total expectation. We have that \\(E[Y] = E[E[Y|X]] = E\\left[\\frac{3X}{10}\\right] = \\frac{3}{10}E[X]\\). Thus, we need to work out \\(E[X]\\), which can be done via the probability mass function of \\(X\\). Specifically, \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X] &= \\sum_{x=1}^{10} x\\frac{44800}{854769} \\frac{3^x}{x!} \\\\\n&= \\frac{44800}{854769} \\sum_{x=1}^{10} \\frac{3^x}{(x-1)!} \\\\\n&= \\frac{44800}{854769}\\times\\frac{67413}{1120} \\\\\n&= \\frac{898840}{284923} \\approx 3.155.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, in total, the expected value of \\(Y\\) will be \\[\\frac{3}{10}\\times\\frac{898840}{284923} = \\frac{269652}{284923} \\approx 0.946.\\]",

A core result relating to conditional expectations and variances connects these concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Law of Total Variance\n\n\n\nFor any random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we can write \\[\\text{var}(X) = E[\\text{var}(X|Y)] + \\text{var}(E[X|Y]).\\] This result can be viewed as decomposing the variance of a random quantity into two separate components, and comes up again in later statistics courses.

    "text": "7.4 Joint Expectations\nThe final set of techniques to consider3 relate to making use of the joint distribution between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Specifically, if we have any function of two random variables, say \\(g(X,Y)\\) and we wish to find \\(E[g(X,Y)]\\). This follows in an exactly analogous derivation to what we have seen so far. In this case, we replace the marginal distribution with the joint distribution. The variance extends in the same manner as well.\n\nDefinition 7.2 (Joint Expectation) The joint expectation of a function (\\(g\\)) of two random variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), is written \\(E[g(X,Y)]\\). This is an expectation computed with respect to the joint distribution of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), giving \\[E[g(X,Y)] = \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}g(x,y)p_{X,Y}(x,y).\\] The joint expectation captures the location of a multivariate function, and is readily extended to more than two random variables.\n\n\nDefinition 7.3 (Joint Variance) The joint variance of a function (\\(g\\)) of two random variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), is written \\(\\text{var}(g(X,Y))\\). This is a variance computed with respect to the joint distribution of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), giving \\[\\text{var}(g(X,Y)) = E[(g(X,Y) - E[g(X,Y)])^2].\\] The joint variance captures the spread of a multivariate function, and is readily extended to more than two random variables.\n\nFor instance, if we want to consider the product of two random variables, we could use this technique to determine \\(E[XY]\\) and \\(\\text{var}(XY)\\).\n\nExample 7.4 (Door-to-Door Charity Chocolate Bars) Charles and Sadie are helping to raise money for a local charity, and to do so, they are going around house-to-house to sell chocolate bars. As they walk between the homes, they realize that depending on where in the city they are, the number of houses that they visit in a day is going to be vary. Moreover, each time they stop by a house, whether or not they will make a sale is uncertain. If, in any given hour, they take \\(Y\\) to be the number of houses that they visit, and \\(X\\) to be the number of chocolate bars that they sell, then they work out that the joint probability mass function of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is given by \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\frac{2y - 1}{36(y + 1)}, \\quad y\\in\\{1,\\dots,6\\}, x\\in\\{0,\\dots,y\\}.\\]\nWhat is the expected number of chocolate bars per house that the visit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want \\(E[g(X,Y)]\\) where \\(g(X,Y) = \\dfrac{X}{Y}\\). Thus, using the defining relationship for joint probabilities we get \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[g(X,Y)] &= E\\left[\\frac{X}{Y}\\right] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{y=1}^{6}\\sum_{x=0}^{y} \\frac{x}{y}\\cdot\\frac{2y - 1}{36(y + 1)} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{y=1}^{6}\\frac{2y-1}{36y(y + 1)}\\sum_{x=0}^{y} x \\\\\n&= \\sum_{y=1}^{6}\\frac{2y-1}{36y(y + 1)}\\cdot\\frac{y(y+1)}{2} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{y=1}^{6}\\frac{2y-1}{72} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{72}\\left[2\\sum_{y=1}^{6} y - \\sum_{y=1}^6 1\\right]\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{72}\\left[42 - 6\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\\] As a result, they sell \\(0.5\\) chocolate bars per house that they visit, on average.\n\n\n\n\nIt is worth considering, briefly, the ways in which conditional and joint expectations interact. Namely, if we know that \\(Y=y\\), then the transformation \\(g(X,y)\\) only has one random component, which is \\(X\\). As a result, taking \\(E[g(X,Y)|Y=y] = E[g(X,y)|Y=y]\\). If instead we use the conditional distribution without a specific value, we still have that \\(Y\\) is fixed within the expression, it is just fixed to an unknown quantity. That is \\(E[g(X,Y)|Y]\\) will be a function of \\(Y\\). We saw before that \\(E[E[X|Y]] = E[X]\\), and the same is true in the joint case. Thus, one technique for computing the joint expectation, \\(g(X,Y)\\) is to first compute the conditional expectation, and then compute the marginal expectation of the resulting quantity.\n\nExample 7.5 (Door-to-Door Charity Chocolate Bars, Marginally Easier) While walking around selling chocolate bars for charity, Charles and Sadie realize that it is fairly straightforward4 to marginalize the joint probability mass function for the number of houses that they visit and the number of chocolate bars that they sell, since \\(X\\) does not actually appear in the equation. That is, when \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\frac{2y - 1}{36(y + 1)}, \\quad y\\in\\{1,\\dots,6\\}, x\\in\\{0,\\dots,y\\},\\] taking the sum \\(\\sum_{x=0}^{y} p_{X,Y}(x,y) = (y+1)p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\dfrac{2y-1}{36}\\). This gives the marginal probability distribution of \\(Y\\). They also realize that this has greatly simplified finding the conditional probability distribution of \\(X\\) given \\(Y\\).\n\nFind the expected value of the number of chocolate bars per house that they sell, given the number of houses they visit.\nUse this result to determine the expected number of chocolate bars sold per visited house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \\[p_{X|Y}(x|y) = \\frac{1}{y+1} \\quad x \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,y\\}.\\] As a result, we can compute \\[E[\\frac{X}{Y}|Y] \\frac{1}{Y}E[X|Y]= \\frac{1}{Y}\\sum_{x=0}^{Y} \\frac{x}{Y+1} = \\frac{1}{Y(Y+1)}\\cdot\\frac{Y(Y+1)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}.\\]\nNote that, \\[E\\left[\\frac{Y}{X}\\right] = E\\left[E\\left[\\left.\\frac{Y}{X}\\right|Y\\right]\\right] = E[0.5] = 0.5,\\] just as before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.1 Linear Combinations of Random Variables\nWith this relationship, we can ask about taking combinations of random variables. For instance, if we have two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we can use this framework to understand how \\(X + Y\\) behaves. An application of these rules with the function \\(g(X,Y) = X + Y\\) gives \\(E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y]\\), and that \\(\\text{var}(X + Y) = \\text{var}(X) + \\text{var}(Y) + 2E[(X-E[X])(Y - E[Y])]\\). Thus, we see that expectations are linear over combinations of random variables, however, variances are not. The term \\(E[(X-E[X])(Y - E[Y])]\\) is called the covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), and it is a measure of how related \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) happen to be.\n\nDefinition 7.4 (Covariance) The covariance of two random variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), is given by \\(\\text{cov}(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]\\). The covariance measures the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), where a positive covariance value means that as \\(X\\) increases, \\(Y\\) will also increase on average (and vice versa). A negative covariance means that as \\(X\\) increases, \\(Y\\) will decrease on average (and vice versa).\n\nThe covariance behaves similarly to the variance. We can see directly from the definition that \\(\\text{cov}(X,X) = \\text{var}(X)\\). Moreover, using similar arguments to those used for the variance, we can show that \\[\\text{cov}(aX+b,cY+d) = ac\\text{cov}(X,Y).\\] Covariances remain linear, so that \\[\\begin{multline*}\\text{cov}(X+Y,X+Y+Z)=\\text{cov}(X,X)+\\text{cov}(X,Y)+\\text{cov}(X,Z)\\\\ +\\text{cov}(Y,X)+\\text{cov}(Y,Y)+\\text{cov}(Y,Z).\\end{multline*}\\] These make covariances somewhat nicer to deal with than variances, and on occasion it may be easier to think of variances as covariances with themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProofs for the Expectation and Variance of Linear Combinations of Random Variables\n\n\n\n\n\nWith \\(g(X,Y) = X+Y\\), we can consider applying the defining relationship for joint expectations. That is \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X+Y] &= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}(x+y)p_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}x\\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}p_{X,Y}(x,y) + \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}y\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}p_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) + \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}yp_Y(y) \\\\\n&= E[X] + E[Y].\\end{align*}\\]\nFor the variances, we apply the variance relationship, giving \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[(X+Y-E[X]-E[Y])^2] &= E[((X-E[X])+(Y-E[Y]))^2] \\\\\n&= E[(X-E[X])^2] + E[(Y-E[Y])^2] \\\\\n&\\quad+ 2E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])] \\\\\n&= \\text{var}(X) + \\text{var}(Y) + 2E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])].\\end{align*}\\] Rewriting the covariance in more common terms gives, \\[\\text{var}(X+Y) = \\text{var}(X) + \\text{var}(Y) + 2\\text{cov}(X,Y).\\]\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.6 (Charles and Sadie’s Orchard Trip) Charles and Sadie adore visiting orchards when the season is right. They are happy to go pick fruit, and then combine everything that they manage together at the end. On one trip to a favourite orchard of theirs they decide to split up and pick separately. This works well enough that on the trip home they decide to start analyzing this behaviour. They take \\(X\\) to be the quantity of fruit picked by Sadie, and \\(Y\\) to be the quantity of fruit picked by Charles. Suppose that they figure that the number of kilograms of fruit jointly picked by them is represented by the probability mass function \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\frac{14xy}{251(x + y)}, \\quad x,y\\in\\{1,\\dots,4\\}.\\]\n\nWhat quantity of fruit does Sadie pick on average? Charles?\nWhat is the variance of fruit picked by Sadie? Charles?\nWhat is the covariance between the amount of fruit that Sadie and Charles each pick?\nWhat is the expected total fruit picked between both Charles and Sadie?\nWhat is the variance of the total fruit picked between both Charles and Sadie?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the joint distribution is symmetric in \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) so they will have equal expected value. We solve for \\(E[X]\\) and note that \\(E[Y]\\) will be the same. \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X] &= \\sum_{x=1}^4 xp_X(x) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x=1}^4 x\\sum_{y=1}^4 p_{X,Y}(x, y) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x=1}^4\\sum_{y=1}^4 \\frac{14x^2y}{251(x + y)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{700}{251} \\approx 2.789.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFor the variance we note that they will also be equivalent between the two individuals. Since we have \\(E[X]\\) already, we simply compute \\(E[X^2]\\) which is given by \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X^2] &= \\sum_{x=1}^4 x^2p_X(x) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x=1}^4 x^2\\sum_{y=1}^4 p_{X,Y}(x, y) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x=1}^4\\sum_{y=1}^4 \\frac{14x^3y}{251(x + y)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{11169}{1255} \\approx 8.900.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, the variance is going to be given by \\[\\text{var}(X) = \\frac{11169}{1255} - \\left(\\frac{700}{251}\\right)^2 = \\frac{353419}{315005}.\\]\nThe covariance is computable using the joint distribution directly, giving \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\text{cov}(X,Y) &= E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x=1}^4\\sum_{y=1}^4 \\left(X-\\frac{700}{251}\\right)\\left(Y-\\frac{700}{251}\\right)\\frac{14xy}{251(x + y)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{17581}{315005} \\approx 0.059\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe want \\(E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y] = \\frac{1400}{251}\\). This could also be computed directly, \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X+Y] &= \\sum_{x=1}^4\\sum_{y=1}^4 (x+y)\\frac{14xy}{251(x + y)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{14}{251}\\sum_{x=1}^4\\sum_{y=1}^{4}xy \\\\\n&= \\frac{14}{251}\\times 100 = \\frac{1400}{251}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe want \\[\\text{var}(X+Y) = \\text{var}(X) + \\text{var}(Y) + 2\\text{cov}(X,Y) = 2\\times\\frac{353419}{315005} + 2\\times\\frac{17581}{315005} = \\frac{148400}{63001}.\\]",

    "text": "7.5 Expectations when Random Variables are Independent\nWhenever we can assume independence of random quantities, we can greatly simplify the expressions we are dealing with. Recall that the key defining relationship with independence is that \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x)p_Y(y)\\). Suppose then that we can write \\(g(X,Y) = g_X(X)h_Y(Y)\\). For instance, for the covariance we have \\(g(X,Y)=(x-E[X])(Y-E[Y])\\) and so \\(g_X(X) = X-E[X]\\) and \\(h_Y(Y) = Y-E[Y]\\). If we want to compute \\(E[g(X,Y)]\\) then we get \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[g(X,Y)] &= E[g_X(X)h_Y(Y)] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}g_X(x)h_Y(y)p_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}g_X(x)h_Y(y)p_X(x)p_Y(y) \\\\\n&=\\sum_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}g_X(x)p_X(x)\\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}}h_Y(y)p_Y(y)\\\\\n&= E[g_X(X)]E[h_Y(Y)].\\end{align*}\\] Thus, whenever random variables are independent, we have the ability to separate them over their expectations. Stated succinctly, whenever \\(X\\perp Y\\), then \\[E[g_X(X)h_Y(Y)] = E[g_X(X)]E[h_Y(Y)].\\]\n\nExample 7.7 (Sadie and Charles Turn back To Dice) With a more thorough understanding of joint distributions, Sadie and Charles turn back to games of chance. They are considering games where dice are rolled a set number of times, and then the total sum is recorded across all of the rolls. They want to understand both what happens in expectation, and the variability of these trials.\n\nSuppose that \\(X_1\\) is a single roll of a die. What is the mean and variance of the roll?\nSuppose that \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are the results from two independent rolls of a die. What is the mean and variance of \\(X_1 + X_2\\).\nSuppose that \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\) are the results from \\(n\\) independent rolls of a die. What is the mean and variance of \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\)?\nSuppose that \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\) are the results from \\(n\\) independent rolls of a die. Moreover, take \\(Z\\) to be the result of an additional independent die roll. What is the mean and variance of \\(Z\\times \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that \\(X_1\\) takes on the values in \\(\\{1,\\dots,6\\}\\) with equal probability each. Thus we have \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X_1] &= \\sum_{x=1}^6 \\frac{x}{6} = \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5 \\\\\nE[X_1^2] &= \\sum_{x=1}^6 \\frac{x^2}{6} = \\frac{91}{6} \\\\\n\\text{var}(X_1) &= \\frac{91}{6} - \\left(\\frac{21}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{35}{12}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNote that because \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are independent, we get \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X_1 + X_2] &= E[X_1] + E[X_2] \\\\\n&= 2\\frac{21}{6} = 7.\\\\\n\\text{var}(X_1 + X_2) &= \\text{var}(X_1) + \\text{var}(X_2) \\\\\n&= 2\\frac{35}{12} = \\frac{35}{6}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNote that because \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are independent, we get \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i] &= \\sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i]\\\\\n&= \\frac{21n}{6}\\\\\n\\text{var}(\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i) &= \\sum_{i=1}^n\\text{var}(X_i)\\\\\n&= \\frac{35n}{12}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNote that \\(Z\\) and \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\) are all independent. As a result if we take \\(T = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\), then \\(T \\perp Z\\) and so \\(E[TZ] = E[T]E[Z]\\). Thus, from (a), (b), and (c) we get \\(E[ZT] = \\frac{21}{6}\\times\\frac{21n}{6} = \\frac{49n}{4}\\).\n\nFor the variance note that we get \\[\\text{var}(TZ) = E[(TZ)^2] - E[TZ]^2 = E[T^2]E[Z^2] - E[TZ]^2.\\] For \\(E[T^2]\\) and \\(E[Z^2]\\) note that \\(E[T^2] = \\text{var}(T) + E[T]^2\\), and similarly for \\(Z\\). Thus \\[E[T^2] = \\frac{35n}{12} + \\left(\\frac{21n}{6}\\right)^2,\\] and \\[E[Z^2] = \\frac{91}{6},\\] thus \\[\\text{var}(TZ) = \\left(\\frac{35n}{12} + \\left(\\frac{21n}{6}\\right)^2\\right)\\left(\\frac{91}{6}\\right) - \\left( \\frac{49n}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{245n(21n + 26)}{144}.\\]\n\n\n\n\nConsider what this means for the covariance between independent random variables. If \\(X\\perp Y\\) then \\[\\text{cov}(X,Y) = E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])] = E[X-E[X]]E[Y-E[Y]].\\] Note that \\(E[X - E[X]] = E[X] - E[X] = 0\\), and the same for \\(E[Y - E[Y]]\\). Thus, if \\(X \\perp Y\\) then \\(\\text{cov}(X, Y) = 0\\). That is to say, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, then \\(\\text{cov}(X,Y)=0\\). It is critical to note that this relationship does not go both ways. You are able to have \\(\\text{cov}(X,Y) = 0\\) even if \\(X\\not\\perp Y\\).\nWhile the covariance is interesting in and of itself, the result allows us to simplify the expression for the variance of a sum of two random variables. Specifically, for independent random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) we also must have that \\(\\text{var}(X+Y)=\\text{var}(X)+\\text{var}(Y)\\). This further extends to more than two random variables, where if (for instance) we have \\(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n\\) all independent, we get both that \\[E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i],\\] and that \\[\\text{var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{var}(X_i).\\] These are relationships that we will use heavily once we begin to consider statistics. Note, this extension to more than two random variables applies to all of the concepts discussed throughout this chapter.\nIn order to do so, the relevant joint distribution, or conditional distribution would need to be substituted into the definitions. Often the complexity here becomes a matter of keeping track of which quantities are random, and which are not. For instance, if we have \\(X,Y,Z\\) as random variables, then \\(E[X|Y,Z]\\) is a random function of \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\). We will still have that \\(E[E[X|Y,Z]] = E[X]\\), however, the outer expectation is now the joint expectation with respect to \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\). As a result, we can also write \\(E[E[X|Y,Z]|Y]\\). The first expectation will be with respect to \\(X|Y,Z\\), while the outer expectation is with respect to \\(Z|Y\\). This is a useful demonstration for when making the distribution of the expectation explicit may help clarify what is being computed. In general, the innermost expectations will always have more conditioning variables than the outer ones. Each time we step out, we peel back one of hte conditional variables until the outermost is either a marginal (or joint). This may help to keep things clear.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "8.1 General Named Distributions and the Discrete Uniform\nSo far, our discussion of probability distributions and their summaries has centered on general results for arbitrary probability mass functions. The basic premise has been that, by knowing a probability mass function, you are able to understand the complete behaviour of a random quantity. Directly from this mass function we are able to derive summaries for the behaviour, for instance describing the location and variability of the random variable. In short by knowing the probability mass function1 we immediately understand how the random variable behaves. We have not, however, spent much time discussing where the probability mass functions actually come from.\nWe have seen one fairly general probability mass function, the one deriving from the equally likely outcomes model. This probability mass function is completely defined by the set of possible values that the random variable can take on. Suppose that we restrict our attention to the sample space being a set of \\(k\\) integers from \\(a\\) through to \\(a+k\\).2 When setup in this way, this distribution is often referred to as the discrete uniform distribution. Typically, we will use the values for the lower bound (\\(a\\)) and the upper bound (\\(b=a+k\\)) to define which discrete uniform we are discussing. If we say that \\(X\\) follows a discrete uniform distribution with parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) we are say that \\(X\\) is a random variable which has an equal probability of taking any of the integers from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). Put differently, we have that \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{b-a+1} & x \\in\\{a,a+1,\\dots,b\\}\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\]\nWhenever we want to say that \\(X\\) follows a particular distribution, wwe use a mathematical shorthand to do so. Specifically, we write \\(X \\sim \\text{Distribution}(\\text{parameters})\\) to mean “\\(X\\) follows the \\(\\text{Distribution}\\) with \\(\\text{parameters}\\).” For instance, if \\(X\\) represents the results of a fair six-sided die roll, we can write \\(X\\sim\\text{Discrete Uniform}(1,6)\\). We will typically shorten this to something like \\(X\\sim\\text{D.Unif}(1,6)\\). Knowing the probability mass function of \\(X\\), we also immediately can work out the expectation and variance for the random variable. Doing this results in \\(E[X] = \\frac{a+b}{2}\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\frac{(b-a+1)^2-1}{12}\\). This means that simply by knowing that a random variable follows a discrete uniform distribution we also immediately know3 any of the properties that we have discussed up until this point.\nThis realization is particularly powerful. There are many real-world quantities which, through inspection, must follow a discrete uniform distribution. For instance, consider rolling a die. In the case of a die roll we take \\(a=1\\), \\(b=6\\), and immediately understand that \\(E[X] = 3.5\\), that \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\frac{17}{6}\\), and that the probability of each value is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). We could do the same calculations for any die with any sides labeled in consecutive order.\nWhile the discrete uniform can be useful for real-world applications, it is also a comparatively simple distribution. The main point of this discussion is not actually to introduce the discrete uniform, but rather to introduce the concept of a named distribution. There are processes in the world which occur frequently enough, in a wide array of settings, with the same underlying structure for their uncertainty. If we study one version of these general processes we can derive the mass function, expectation, and variance for them. Then, we are easily able to describe the probabilistic behaviour of other quantities following a similar process. At that point, understanding the uncertainty of random quantities becomes a matter of matching the processes to the correct distribution, and then applying what we know about that distribution directly. While not every process will directly correspond to a known, named distribution, we can often get very close using just a handful of these.5\nFor each named distribution there is an underlying structure describing the scenarios in which it arises. For instance, for the discrete uniform, this is when there is a set of equally likely outcomes which can be described using consecutive integers. Once matched, there will is a probability mass function, an expected value, and a variance associated with the distribution. Importantly, all of these quantities will depend on some parameters. In the discrete uniform we used the parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). These parameters specify which version of the distribution is relevant for the underlying scenario.\nIt is best to think of the named distributions as families of distributions, with specific iterations being dictated by the parameter values. If two processes follow the same distribution with different parameters they will not be identically distributed, they are simply drawn from the same family. If two processes have the same parameter values and the same underlying distribution, they are identically distributed and their probabilistic behaviour will be exactly the same. For instance, there is no probabilistic difference between rolling a fair, six-sided die or drawing a card at random from a set of \\(6\\) cards labelled \\(1\\) through \\(6\\). There may be real-world differences which matter, but from a probabilistic point of view, they are exactly the same. This is a useful realization as it allows the use of simple models to understand more complex phenomenon.",

To do so, they start discussing a number of possibilities, each of them trying to describe whether and how different quantities obey the distribution.\nFor each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a justification of why a discrete uniform would (or would not be) appropriate, including a description of the parameters.\n\nAt a recent hockey game, Charles and Sadie were spectators and the 50-50 raffle was selected by choosing the seat number between \\(1\\) and \\(4000\\).\nCharles’ sibling is having a child, and Charles has been thinking about what day of the week the child is going to be born on.\nSadie enjoys playing the birthday-guessing-game when in public, wherein Sadie attempts to guess what day of the year random patrons of the coffee shop were born on.\nIn their free time, Charles and Sadie enjoy playing role-playing games. These games often necessitate the rolling of dice, from the standard six-sided ones, through to large twenty-sided dice, or smaller three-sided ones.\nCharles’ struggles to wake up in the mornings and as a result uses an alarm that plays a random song on a streaming music service. The song is selected from Charles’ library at random, keeping each morning exciting!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe winning seat can be treated as a random variable, \\(X\\), which is distributed according to \\(\\text{D.Unif}(1, 4000)\\). The mean and variance are not particularly meaningful in this setting, however, each individual will have a constant probability of winning.\nIf the days of the week are labelled \\(1\\) through \\(7\\) (say, Sunday through Saturday), then it is reasonable to suspect that \\(Y\\) representing the numerically-encoded day of the week will follow approximately a \\(\\text{D. Unif}(1,7)\\). It may be arguable that some days are less likely than others to be born on (empirically, Sundays appear to have about \\(0.12\\) which is less than \\(1\\) in \\(7\\)), however, it is probably a reasonably close approximation.\nHere we can either view Sadie’s guess or the true birthday as the random quantity. If Sadie truly guesses at random then it is likely this will follow a \\(\\text{D. Unif}(1, 365)\\), being well-represented by the discrete uniform. For one’s true birthdays, if we are willing to ignore seasonal birth effects and leap years, then it is reasonable to assume that it too will be \\(\\text{D. Unif}(1,365)\\), however, these are both effects that do truly exist and would slightly alter from the uniform probabilities.\nEach roll of the die gives a discrete uniform based on the number of sides that it has. For any \\(d\\) sided die, we can represent it via a \\(\\text{D. Unif}(1,d)\\). In these types of games, the mean and variance are more pertinent than in most of the other examples we have discussed. Importantly, if we roll multiple dice and take a sum (or a maximum, minimum, etc.) these no longer will be described by the uniform distribution.\nIf Charles were to enumerate the songs on the streaming service with \\(1\\) to \\(n\\), then the played song may follow a \\(\\text{D. Unif}(1, n)\\) distribution.4",

    "section": "8.2 The Bernoulli Distribution",
    "text": "8.2 The Bernoulli Distribution\nPerhaps the best way to demonstrate the effectiveness of these simple models is to introduce one of the most basic named probability distribution, the Bernoulli distribution.6 The Bernoulli distribution characterizes any statistical experiment with a binary outcome when these results are denoted \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). The parameter that indexes the distribution is \\(p\\), which gives the probability of observing a \\(1\\). The most straightforward application of a Bernoulli random variable is the flip of a coin. Take \\(X=1\\) if a head is shown, and \\(X=0\\) if a tails is shown. Then \\(X\\sim\\text{Bern}(p)\\)7, with \\(p=0.5\\). If \\(X\\sim\\text{Bern}(p)\\) then we know that \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases} p^x(1-p)^{1-x} & x\\in\\{0,1\\}\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\] Further, we can show that that \\(E[X] = p\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = p(1-p)\\). We typically call \\(X=1\\) a “success” and \\(X=0\\) a “failure” when discussing Bernoulli random variables.\nA coin flip is, by itself, not particularly interesting. However any statistical experiment with binary outcomes coded this way can be seen as a Bernoulli random variable. Suppose, for instance, you are interested in whether you will pass a particular course or not. There are two options, a “success” (passing) and a “failure” (failing), and the chances of this are governed by some probability \\(p\\). Alternatively, suppose you want to know whether the next flight you take will land safely, or whether a particular medical treatment will effectively treat an illness. These are the same situations. Each of these scenarios is analyzed in exactly the same way as a coin toss: the probabilities change, but the underlying functions and mathematical objects do not. There is no probabilistic difference between determining whether a coin will come up heads or whether a plane will safely land.\n\nExample 8.2 (Charles and Sadie find Bernoulli Quantities) In their ongoing quest to best understand the named distributions, Charles ans Sadie continue their discussions of various quantities, and how they may fit a Bernoulli distribution.\nFor each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a justification of why a Bernoulli distribution would (or would not be) appropriate, including a description of the parameter.\n\nCharles and Sadie think about entering their favourite coffee shop, and seeing whether or not there is seating available for them.\nCharles thinks about the games that they have played deciding on who would have to pay, based on the outcomes of a few coin tosses.\nSadie is going on a trip shortly, and wonders whether or not the plane will be running on schedule.\nCharles and Sadie are big sports fans, and want to know whether the local team will win the upcoming match.\nSadie wants to take out a book from the library, but is not sure whether it is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case we can treat \\(X=1\\) as there being seating available (“success”) and \\(X=0\\) as there not being seating available. The parameter, \\(p\\) would be given by the probability that there is seating available, which is likely not a known probability directly.\nIn this case we can treat \\(X=1\\) as Sadie having to pay, with \\(X=0\\) as Charles having to pay. The parameter \\(p\\) corresponds to the probability that Sadie pays, which in most of the original examples would have \\(p=0.5\\).\nIn this case we can treat \\(X=1\\) as the plane being on time, and \\(X=0\\) as it being late. The parameter \\(p\\) would correspond to the probability that the plane is late.\nIn this case we can treat \\(X=1\\) as the team winning the game, and \\(X=0\\) as them losing. The parameter \\(p\\) would correspond to the probability that they win.\nIn this case we can treat \\(X=1\\) as the book being available, and \\(X=0\\) as it being not available. The parameter \\(p\\) would correspond to the probability that it is available.",

    "section": "8.3 The Binomial Distribution",
    "text": "8.3 The Binomial Distribution\nA natural extension to tossing a coin once and seeing if it comes up heads or not is tossing a coin \\(n\\) times and counting how many times it comes up heads. If we take \\(X\\) to be the number of “successes” in \\(n\\) independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials, then we say that \\(X\\) has a binomial distribution. The binomial distribution is characterized by two different parameters, the number of trials that are being performed, denoted \\(n\\), and the probability of a success on each trial, \\(p\\). We write \\(X\\sim\\text{Bin}(n,p)\\).\n\nExample 8.3 (Missing All the Good Games) Charles and Sadie often will attend hockey games together for their local team. In order to keep their costs down, they try not to go to every single game. Instead, each time a game comes around that they can both attend, they roll a die. If it is a \\(3\\) or higher, they go, otherwise they stay home. One season they are looking back over the \\(30\\) games, and seeing which they attended and which they did not. The team won \\(19\\) of the games, and lost the other \\(11\\). However, of the \\(18\\) games that Charles and Sadie attended that season, they saw all \\(11\\) losses and only \\(7\\) of the wins! They cannot help but feel like they got very unlucky.\n\nHow many wins should Charles and Sadie have expected to see?\nWhat is the variance in the number of wins that they could have expected?\nWhat is the probability that, for a season record of \\(19\\) wins and \\(11\\) losses, they would have been present for \\(7\\) or fewer wins?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we take \\(X\\) to represent the number of winning games that Sadie and Charles are present for. In this case, looking back on the season, we know that \\(X\\) is going to be binomial with \\(n=19\\) and \\(p = \\dfrac{2}{3}\\), since they go if a \\(3\\) or greater is rolled on the die. Thus, we can take \\(X \\sim \\text{Bin}(19, \\dfrac{2}{3})\\).\n\n\\(E[X] = np = \\dfrac{2}{3}(19) = 12.666\\). Thus they should have expected to see around \\(12\\) or \\(13\\) wins.\n\\(\\text{var}(X) = np(1-p) = 4.222\\).\nWe want \\(P(X \\leq 7)\\). For this we get \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(X \\leq 7) &= \\sum_{x=0}^7 p_X(x) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x=0}^7 \\binom{19}{x}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^x\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{19-x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2876233}{387420489} \\\\\n&\\approx 0.0074.\n\\end{align*}\\] This leaves them very unlucky.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we know that \\(X\\sim\\text{Bin}(n,p)\\) then we also know that \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases} \\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} & x\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,n\\} \\\\ 0 &\\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\] This is the first distribution we have seen which knowing the underlying distribution would not have immediately translated into knowing the probability mass function, which begins to illustrate why this is a useful area of study. We can work out that \\(E[X] = np\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = np(1-p)\\).\n\nExample 8.4 (Charles and Sadie find Binomial Quantities) The adventures in understanding named distributions continue, this time Charles ans Sadie wonder where they may find Binomial distributions.\nFor each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a justification of why a Binomial distribution would (or would not be) appropriate, including a description of the parameters.\n\nCharles rolls ten, six-sided dice, counting up the number of them which show a \\(1\\).\nCharles and Sadie reflect on the record of who has paid during their past \\(20\\) visits to the coffee shop.\nSadie starts playing on a baseball league that uses a pitching machine, and wants to know, without practicing, how many hits occur in the first \\(20\\) at bats.\nCharles and Sadie distribute flyers for an upcoming concert that their folk-punk band is putting on. They hand out \\(50\\) flyers and are wondering how many people will show.\nCharles and Sadie form a pub trivia team with some friends. One day, their friend who specializes in history is gone one day, and \\(5\\) multiple choice history questions come up. They want to know what their score will be randomly guessing on those questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of dice showing a \\(1\\) is represented by a \\(\\text{Bin}(10, \\dfrac{1}{6})\\) distribution. Each die has an equal chance of showing a \\(1\\), independently from all other rolls, and each roll will definitely be either a \\(1\\) or not a \\(1\\).\nWe can take \\(X\\) to represent the number of times that Charles has paid. This will be given by a \\(\\text{Bin}(20, 0.5)\\) distribution. Each time both are equally likely to pay, independent of all other times, and one of them will always pay.\nWe can take \\(X\\) to be the number of hits, and then claim that this will follow a \\(\\text{Bin}(20, p)\\) distribution, where \\(p\\) is the probability that Sadie makes a hit. The caveats that the pitching machine is used and that Sadie does not practice are important since if different pitches were used, or different skill levels emerged as time progresses, then it may not satisfy the conditions of a binomial distribution.\nHere we can take \\(X\\), the number who attend the show, as a \\(\\text{Bin}(50,p)\\), where \\(p\\) is the probability that any individual who saw the flyer attends the show. In order for this to hold we need to assume that all individuals choose to attend or not individually, without influence from anyone else, and that the probability is constant across different people.\nSuppose that there are \\(4\\) multiple choice options, then the number they answer correctly will follow a \\(\\text{Bin}(5,0.25)\\) distribution. Assuming that their guesses are independent across the different questions, and that they do not have a better sense for some questions than others.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the binomial distribution can be constructed by summing independent and identically distributed Bernoulli variables. Specifically, if \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\stackrel{iid}{\\sim}\\text{Bern}(p)\\)8 then taking \\[Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\] gives a binomial distribution, with \\(n\\) and \\(p\\). To understand this intuitively, note that if a Bernoulli comes up \\(1\\) when we get a heads on a single flip of the coin, then if we flip the coin \\(n\\) times and count the number of heads this is the same as counting the number of \\(1\\)s from each corresponding Bernoulli trial. Once we know this construction, we can use the properties we have previously seen about independent random variables to work out the mean and variance for the distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction of Binomial Random Variables\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we take \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} \\text{Bern}(p)\\). Then, if we define \\[Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\] we can work out \\(E[Y]\\) and \\(\\text{var}(Y)\\) directly. First, \\[E[Y] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i] = nE[X_i] = np.\\] Moreover, owing to independence we get \\[\\text{var}(Y) = \\text{var}(\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{var}(X_i) = np(1-p).\\] These are the same as what was listed for the binomial directly. We are also able to derive the probability mass function of the binomial using this construction.\nIf we note that \\(P(X_1 = x) = p^{x}(1-p)^{1-x}\\), then be independence we cna write the joint probability mass function as the product of these, which gives: \\[\\begin{multline*}P(X_1=x_1, X_2 = x_2, \\dots, X_k = x_k) = p^{x_1}(1-p)^{1-x_1}p^{x_2}(1-p)^{1-x_2}\\cdots p^{x_n}(1-p)^{1-x_n} \\\\ = p^{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}(1-p)^{n-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} = p^{y}(1-p)^{n-y}.\\end{multline*}\\] Consider how we could have \\(Y = k\\), for some \\(k\\in\\{0,\\dots,n\\}\\). In order for this to be the case we would require exactly \\(k\\) of the \\(n\\) Bernoulli random variables to be \\(1\\) and the other \\(n-k\\) to be \\(0\\). So, for instance, we may have \\(\\{X_1 = 1, X_2 = 1, \\dots, X_k = 1, X_{k+1} = 0, \\dots, X_n = 0\\}\\). If we consider choosing which of the \\(n\\) trials should be \\(1\\), we know that there will be \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) of these, and so that gives the number of disjoint combinations that satisfy \\(Y=k\\). Combining this with the joint probability mass function we worked out gives \\[P(Y=y) = \\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k},\\] as required.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that, to get the binomial distribution, we have made several key assumptions. First, we are counting the number of successes in a fixed number of trials. In order for something to be binomially distributed, we must know in advance how many trials there are under consideration. Second, each of these trials must be independent of one another. The outcome on one cannot impact any of the others. Third, there must be a constant probability of success across all trials. If the probabilities are shifting overtime, then a binomial is no longer appropriate.\n\nExample 8.5 (Charles’ and Sadie’s Binomial Mistakes) In trying to learn about the binomial distribution, Charles and Sadie identified several candidates for quantities which did not satisfy a binomial distribution. For each of the following, help Charles and Sadie understand why a Binomial distribution would not be appropriate.\n\nCharles rolls ten dice, of various different sizes, counting up the number of them which show a \\(1\\).\nCharles and Sadie are considering the weather for the next week, thinking about how many days there will be rain.\nCharles and Sadie consider handing out flyers for their band’s concert, and give \\(10\\) flyers to a group of \\(10\\) friends walking by.\nSadie is considering a particular major league baseball player, considering the number of hits in a set number of at bats.\nCharles and Sadie are playing a game where they roll a die, then flip a coin the number of times that is shown on the die, counting up the total number of heads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue in this case is that, if the dice have different numbers of sides, the probability that they show a \\(1\\) will not be constant. As a result, there is no value of \\(p\\) that gives the probability of success on each trial.\nThe issue in this case is two-fold. First, it is unlikely that there is going to be a constant probability of rain. Even if there is, or we treat it as though it will be, it is unlikely that one day is independent of the next, all the time. That is to say, today’s weather likely impacts tomorrows, removing independence.\nIn this case, it is unlikely that the group of \\(10\\) friends will independently decide to go or not. Likely if one goes, many will, and vice versa.\nThe issue here is that batters will bat against different pitches, which changes the probability of a hit. That is, some pitchers are less talented, and thus there is a higher probability of getting a hit against them.\nThe issue here is that there is not a set number of trials. Instead, the number of trials is random and dependent on the outcome of a previous statistical experiment.",

    "text": "8.4 The Geometric Distribution\nThe binomial counted the number of successes in a fixed number of trials. We may be interested in a related question, namely “how many trials would be needed to see a success?” Instead of “how many heads in \\(n\\) flips of a coin?” we may ask “how many flips of a coin to get a head?” Much like the binomial, these quantities will be intimately tied to the Bernoulli distribution. Once more we are envisioning a sequence of independent and identically distributed trials being performed. However, instead of knowing that we will stop after \\(n\\) trials have been conducted, here we will only stop once we see a particular result. Any random quantities following this process are said to follow a geometric distribution. The geometric distribution is parameterized with a single parameter, \\(p\\), the probability of success. We write \\(X\\sim\\text{Geo}(p)\\), and have that \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases}(1-p)^{x-1}p & x \\geq 1 \\\\  0 & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\] If \\(X\\sim\\text{Geo}(p)\\), then \\(E[X] = \\frac{1}{p}\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\frac{1-p}{p^2}\\).\n\nExample 8.6 (Charles Plays Darts) Sadie is a very accomplished darts player. Charles is not. Despite Sadie’s best efforts, when Charles plays darts it is essentially randomly choosing an area on the dartboard. In one friendly game, Charles decides to only aim at the highest scoring region of the board - the triple twenty. This region occupies about \\(0.9\\%\\) of the total area, and the two friends play with a rule where if Charles misses entirely, another dart is thrown. Charles is curious as to how many darts are going to be needed to be thrown until a triple twenty is hit.\n\nFind the expected number of darts required.\nFind the variance in the total number of darts required.\nWhat is the probability that it takes more than \\(5\\) total throws to get a triple twenty?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a geometric distribution with \\(p=0.009\\). Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Geo}(p)\\) represent the number of darts that Charles sees.\n\nThe expected number of darts required, \\(E[X]\\) is given by \\(1/p\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{1}{0.009} = 111.\\dot1\\).\nThe variance of the expected number of darts, \\(\\text{var}(X)\\) is given by \\(\\frac{1-p}{p^2} = 12234.5679\\).\nTo find \\(P(X \\geq 5)\\) it is simpler to work with \\(P(X &lt; 5) = P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X = 3) + P(X=4)\\). Then we take \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(X \\geq 5) &= 1 - P(X &lt; 5) \\\\\n&= 1 - (P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X = 3) + P(X=4))\\\\\n&= 1 - (0.009)(1-0.009)^{1-1} - (0.009)(1-0.009)^{2-1} \\\\\n&\\quad - (0.009)(1-0.009)^{3-1} - (0.009)(1-0.009)^{4-1} \\\\\n&= 1 - (0.009)[1 + 0.991 + 0.991^2 + 0.991^3] \\\\\n&= 0.964483...\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, with more than \\(96\\%\\) probability, Charles will take \\(X\\) or more dart throws to hit the triple twenty.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geometric distribution differs from other named distributions that we have considered in that the random variable can take on an infinite number of possible values. The probability that \\(X\\) exceeds a very large threshold shrinks to \\(0\\), however, there is no maximum value that can be observed. To form the geometric random variable we assume that we are performing independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials, and that we stop only after the first observed success.9\n\nExample 8.7 (Charles and Sadie find Geometric Quantities) Still working through their distributional knowledge, Charles and Sadie are now hoping to identify geometric quantities.\nFor each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a justification of why a Geometric distribution would (or would not be) appropriate, including a description of the parameter.\n\nCharles continues to roll a six-sided die until a \\(6\\) is gotten.\nSadie has paid for coffee for the last several times, they are both wondering how many more times until Charles will have to pay.\nCharles is considering a new job which would require a whole lot of plane travel, and so Charles begins to wonder how many flights will run on time before the first delay.\nSadie, in a round of guess-their-birthday, starts to count the number of people it takes (guessing one birthday for each person) until a birthday is guessed correctly.\nCharles and Sadie very much enjoy a particular brand of vegan peach yogurt, but it is hard to find. They want to consider how many stores they need to visit before they find it in stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be \\(\\text{Geo}(\\dfrac{1}{6})\\), as the trials are all independent and identically distributed, and the rolling stops at the first success.\nIf we define “Charles has to pay” as a success, then the number of visits to the coffee shop, starting today, until Charles pays will be \\(\\text{Geo}(\\dfrac{1}{2})\\). Each trial is independent and identically distributed, and we stop counting when Charles pays.\nIn order for this to follow a geometric distribution we would require that each plane is equally likely to be delayed, and that there is no influence from one plane to another. If so, we take \\(p\\) to be the probability that a plane is delayed, and then \\(X\\) is the number of flights up-to and including the first delayed flight, and \\(X\\sim\\text{Geo}(p)\\).\nAssuming that Sadie makes guesses independently of one another, each with a probability of \\(\\dfrac{1}{365}\\) of being correct, then this will be \\(X\\sim\\text{Geo}(\\dfrac{1}{365})\\).\nIf each store stocks with probability, \\(p\\), then the total number of stores until they purchase will be \\(\\text{Geo}(p)\\). However, this will assume that each store is out-of-stock independently of each other store, and this seems unlikely to be the case supposing (for instance) a common supplier.",

    "text": "8.5 The Negative Binomial Distribution\nA natural way to make the geometric distribution more flexible is to not stop after the first success, but rather after a set number of successes. That is, instead of flipping a coin until we see a head, we flip a coin until we see \\(r\\) heads. Any random quantity which follows this general pattern is said to follow a negative binomial distribution. We use two parameters to describe the negative binomial distribution, \\(r\\) the number of successes we are looking to achieve, and \\(p\\) the probability of a success on any given trial. We write \\(X\\sim\\text{NB}(r,p)\\). If we know that \\(X\\sim\\text{NB}(r,p)\\), then we immediately get \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases}\\binom{x-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{x-r} & x\\geq r \\\\ 0 &\\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\] Moreover, we have \\(E[X] = \\frac{r}{p}\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}\\). Setting \\(r=1\\), we get the same quantities explored in the case of the geometric distribution. That is, if \\(X \\sim \\text{NB}(1,p)\\) then we can also say that \\(X \\sim \\text{Geo}(p)\\).10\n\nExample 8.8 (Charles and Sadie Try to Balance the Dart Game) Charles and Sadie have been continuing to play darts quite often together, and though Charles is improving, Sadie’s expertise still makes it an unfair game. As a result, they consider playing alternative versions of the game in which Sadie is at a disadvantage in order to make things more fair. Charles has improved so that \\(20\\%\\) of the time, the aimed for area of the dart board is hit. Sadie, on the other hand, hits with \\(60\\%\\) accuracy. Suppose that they are considering a game where Charles has to hit a spot \\(3\\) times, and then Sadie has to hit the same spot \\(r\\) times. They are trying to figure out \\(r\\) to make the game fair.\n\nHow many tosses will it take, on average, for Charles to hit the area on the target \\(3\\) times?\nWhat should Charles and Sadie make \\(r\\), if they want it to take Sadie the same number of tosses on average as Charles?\nIf they set \\(r\\) as in (b), who has a higher variance in the number of tosses it takes?\nWhat is the probability that Charles wins before Sadie has a chance to win?\nWhat is the probability that Sadie wins on the first available turn?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(X\\) be the number of tosses it takes for Charles and \\(Y\\) to be the number of tosses it takes for Sadie. We have that \\(X \\sim \\text{NB}(3, 0.2)\\), while \\(Y\\sim\\text{NB}(r, 0.6)\\).\n\nWe know that \\(E[X] = \\dfrac{3}{0.2} = 15\\).\nWe have that \\(E[Y] = \\dfrac{r}{0.6}\\). Setting this equal to \\(15\\) gives \\[\\frac{r}{0.6} = 15 \\implies r = 15(0.6) = 9.\\] Thus, they should set \\(r = 9\\).\nWe have that \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\dfrac{3(0.8)}{0.2^2} = 60\\) while \\(\\text{var}(Y) = \\dfrac{9(0.4)}{0.6^2} = 10\\). Thus, Charles has a far greater variance in the total number of tosses than Sadie.\nIn order for Charles to win before Sadie has a chance, this would require \\(X &lt; 9\\). Thus, \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(X &lt; 9) &= \\sum_{x=3}^8 p_X(x) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x=3}^8 \\binom{x-1}{2}(0.2)^3(0.8)^{x-3} \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{0.2}{0.8}\\right)^3\\left[\\binom{2}{2} + \\binom{3}{2}(0.8) + \\binom{4}{2}(0.8)^2 + \\binom{5}{2}(0.8)^3 \\right.\\\\\n&\\quad\\left.+ \\binom{6}{2}(0.8)^4 + \\binom{7}{2}(0.8)^5\\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{79329}{390625} \\approx 0.203.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, approximately \\(20\\%\\) of the time Charles will win before Sadie even can.\nThe probability that Sadie wins on the first turn is \\(P(Y = 9)\\). We get \\[p_Y(9) = \\binom{8}{8}(0.6)^9(0.4)^{9-9} = \\frac{19683}{1953125} = 0.010078.\\] Thus it is only around a \\(1\\%\\) chance that Sadie wins on turn \\(9\\), the earliest possible turn for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.9 (Charles and Sadie find Negative Binomial Quantities) Having mastered many different distributions, Charles and Sadie fix their attention of finding the negative binomial quantities in the world around them.\nFor each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a justification of why a negative binomial distribution would (or would not be) appropriate, including a description of the parameters.\n\nCharles continues to roll a six-sided die until there have been a total of six \\(6\\)s seen.\nCharles sets aside \\(\\$100\\) for coffee purchases in a different account. If Charles and Sadie’s order comes to \\(\\$6.25\\) per trip, how many trips until the account needs to be restocked.\nSadie decided that poker is very fun to play after the first time getting a royal flush.11 Sadie is very interested how many more hands of poker are likely to be needed until this feeling comes around a few more times.\nCharles is continuing to crochet. Charles wants to know how many granny squares are needed to be made until there are enough squares without any errors to give as holiday gifts this year.\nSadie and Charles need to sell a total of ten chocolate bars for their fundraiser. They want to know how many houses they will need to visit in order to achieve this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach trial here is independent, identically distributed with a constant probability. Charles stops after \\(6\\) successes, and as a result the negative binomial is satisfied. \\(X\\) will follows a \\(\\text{NB}(6, \\dfrac{1}{6})\\) distribution.\nNote that at \\(\\$6.25\\) per order, \\(\\$100\\) buys \\(16\\) orders. As a result, this process will end after \\(16\\) “successes”, which is to say, times when Charles has to pay. We know from past examples that the probability Charles pays is \\(0.5\\), independent of all other cases, and as a result this will follow a \\(\\text{NB}(16, 0.5)\\) distribution.\nThe probability of getting a royal flush is constant in poker hands12 Moreover, Sadie is interested in a set number of royal flushes being achieved (a few more maybe means \\(3\\) or so), and as a result, this falls into the category of negative binomial with \\(r\\) set to the number Sadie wants to see, and \\(p\\) being the probability of seeing a royal flush, which is approximately \\(\\dfrac{4}{\\binom{52}{5}}\\), depending on the type of poker being played.\nAssuming that there are a set number of holiday gifts that Charles wants to give, then we can take this to be \\(r\\) from the negative binomial distribution. Assuming that Charles’ odds of making a mistake on any granny square are constant at \\(p\\), then we can take the probability of success as \\(1-p\\). Under these assumptions, and assuming the squares are all independent of one another, then this will be \\(\\text{NB}(r, 1-p)\\).\nIf we assume that each house, independently, buys chocolate bars with a constant probability, \\(p\\), then this will follow a \\(\\text{NB}(10, p)\\) distribution.",

    "section": "8.6 The Hypergeometric Distribution",
    "text": "8.6 The Hypergeometric Distribution\nOne of the use cases demonstrated for the binomial distribution is drawing with replacement. In order for the binomial distribution to be relevant it must be the case that the probability of a success is unchanging, and correspondingly, if the process under consideration is random draws from a population then these draws must be with replacement. Otherwise the probabilities would shift.13 Suppose that we are wish to draw the ace of spades from a standard, shuffled deck of \\(52\\) cards. If we begin drawing cards without returning them to the deck after each draw, the probability that the next draw is the ace of spades is increasing over the draws. At first, the probability is \\(\\dfrac{1}{52}\\). If the first card is not the ace of spades, then the next draw it will be \\(\\dfrac{1}{51}\\). This continues until eventually the probability will grow to be \\(1\\). As a result, this type of scenario does not fit into the independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials that we have been exploring.\nWe require a different setup to model drawing without replacement from a finite population. Suppose that our population consists of two types of items, “successes” and “failures”. If we are interested in counting how many successes we see in a set number of draws, then this random quantity will follow a hypergeometric distribution. The hypergeometric distribution is parameterized using three different parameters: the number of items in the population, \\(N\\), the number of these which are considered successes, \\(M\\), and the total number of items that are to be drawn without replacement, \\(n\\). We write \\(X\\sim\\text{HG}(N,M,n)\\). If \\(X\\sim\\text{HG}(N,M,n)\\) then \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases}\\frac{\\binom{N-M}{n-x}\\binom{M}{x}}{\\binom{N}{n}} & x\\in\\{\\max\\{0,M-N+n\\},\\dots,\\min\\{n,M\\}\\} \\\\ 0 &\\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\] Moreover, \\(E[X] = \\frac{nM}{N}\\) and the variance is given by \\[\\text{var}(X) = n\\frac{M}{N}\\frac{N-M}{N}\\frac{N-n}{N-1}.\\]\n\nExample 8.10 (Charles Sock Drawer) Charles firmly believes that socks should not be sold in pairs.14 As a result, Charles has decided to keep socks unpaired, free floating in the drawers. In Charles’ sock drawer there are \\(13\\) individual white socks, \\(8\\) individual black socks, and \\(9\\) individual red socks. One day, Charles is trying to wear matching socks because of a fancy dinner party, however, it is dark when the socks are being selected.\n\nIf Charles takes two socks from the drawer, what is the probability that there is a matching pair of white socks?\nIf Charles takes two socks from the drawer, what is the probability that there is a matching pair of any colour?\nIf Charles takes \\(5\\) socks, how many of them are expected to be red? What is the variance of the number of red socks?\nHow many socks should Charles take out in order to expect to receive at least \\(2\\) black socks?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can view this as a hypergeometric distribution, where the specific parameters depend on what we are defining as a success. There will always be \\(N=30\\), and \\(n\\) will correspond to the number of socks that are drawn.\n\nHere there are \\(M=13\\) successes, \\(N=30\\), and \\(n=2\\). We wish to know \\(p_X(2)\\), and so we find \\[p_X(2) = \\frac{\\binom{N-M}{n-x}\\binom{M}{x}}{\\binom{N}{n}} = \\frac{\\binom{30-13}{0}\\binom{13}{2}}{\\binom{30}{2}} = \\frac{26}{145} \\approx 0.1793.\\]\nWe can say that \\(P(\\text{Pair}) = P(\\text{Pair of White}) + P(\\text{Pair of Red}) + P(\\text{Pair of Black})\\). We found \\(P(\\text{Pair of White})\\) in (a), and the remaining terms will be similar, changing \\(M=9\\) for the red socks, and \\(M=8\\) for the black socks. Thus, \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{Pair of Red}) &= \\frac{\\binom{30-9}{0}\\binom{9}{2}}{\\binom{30}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{12}{145} \\\\\nP(\\text{Pair of Black}) &= \\frac{\\binom{30-8}{0}\\binom{8}{2}}{\\binom{30}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{28}{435} \\\\\nP(\\text{Pair}) &= \\frac{26}{145} + \\frac{12}{145} + \\frac{28}{435} \\\\\n&= \\frac{142}{435} \\\\\n&= 0.3264.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, there is approximately a \\(33\\%\\) chance that Charles draws a pair of socks.\nHere we have \\(M=9\\) and \\(n=5\\). Thus, we find \\[E[X] = \\frac{(5)(9)}{30} = 1.5,\\] and so \\(1.5\\) red socks are to be expected.15 For the variance, we get \\[\\text{var}(X) = 5\\cdot\\frac{9}{30}\\cdot\\frac{30-9}{30}\\cdot\\frac{30-5}{30-1} = \\frac{105}{116} \\approx 0.905.\\]\nIn this case we want \\(M=8\\). In order to have \\(E[X] \\geq 2\\) we require \\[\\frac{n(8)}{30} \\geq 2 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{2(30)}{8} = 7.5,\\] and so Charles should draw at least \\(8\\) socks in order to expect to have at least \\(2\\) black socks in the set of drawn ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hypergeometric Distribution, Binomial Distribution, and Survey Sampling\n\n\n\nThe hypergeometric is closely linked to the binomial distribution. If we consider the population described in the hypergeometric setup then the probability of a success on the first draw is \\(p=\\frac{M}{N}\\). Note that \\(E[X] = np\\), exactly the same as in the binomial. However, plugging this in for the variance we get \\(\\text{var}(X) = np(1-p)\\frac{N-n}{N-1}\\). Notice that if \\(n=1\\), this extra term is simply \\(1\\), and for \\(n &gt; 1\\) it will be less than \\(1\\). As a result, the variance of the hypergeometric is smaller than the variance of the corresponding binomial. This makes intuitive sense. In the hypergeometric setup, the fact that draws are without replacement means that as more draws go on the probability of observing a success increases, reducing the likelihood of long runs of no observed successes. There is a cap on the behaviour of the random quantity thanks to the finiteness of the population. Correspondingly, the multiplicative term by which the variance shrinks, \\(\\frac{N-n}{N-1}\\) is referred to as the finite population correction. This factor differentiates the behaviour of the hypergeometric and the binomial.\nNote that as \\(N\\) becomes very, very large, as long as \\(n\\) is small by comparison, the finite population correction will approach \\(1\\). In other words, drawing without replacement in a large enough sample behaves almost exactly the same as drawing with replacement in the same sample. The binomial distribution can be used to approximate the hypergeometric distribution, so long as the population is very large. Again, this makes sense intuitively. If you have a deck with a million cards in it, and you are going to draw \\(2\\), whether or not you return the first one to the deck has very little bearing on the probabilities associated with this scenario. Generally, the binomial distribution is easier to work with, so this approximation can be useful in some settings.\nThese types of considerations are deeply important in the field of survey sampling. In survey sampling, researchers select individuals from a population of interest, and have them respond to questions, or collect information on the respondents. You can think of, for instance, surveys that the university sends out or Canada-wide surveys trying to gauge sentiment on various policies. Generally in a survey you are going to be sampling without replacement: you will not include the same person in your sample more than once. However, it may also be the case that you are taking a fairly small sample (say \\(n=1000\\)) from a very large population (say \\(N=40000000\\)), at which point the finite population correction factor equals \\(0.999975\\). This may as well be \\(1\\) and you can simplify matters by using binomial probabilities.\n\n\n\nExample 8.11 (Charles and Sadie find Hypergeometric Quantities) Charles and Sadie have almost made it through the set of distributions that they want to learn, now moving on to the hypergeometric.\nFor each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a justification of why a hypergeometric distribution would (or would not be) appropriate, including a description of the parameters.\n\nWhen streaming music, Charles will often shuffle the entire library. While listening through, Charles keeps tracks of the number of songs that come on which are favourites.\nSadie is considering the number of spades that are likely to show up in different poker hands, from different versions of the game where hands may not be \\(5\\) cards.\nCharles and Sadie run a book club with some of their closest friends. Before each meeting, they take an anonymous vote as to whether the book was enjoyed or not, so that they know the total number of individuals who actually enjoyed the reading. If they know how many people will show up to a meeting, they are interested in how many of those people will have enjoyed the book.\nSadie learns of black swans, and wants to understand how many are likely to be seen if Sadie starts to view swans at a swan sanctuary.\nCharles and Sadie are invited to partake in a survey. The survey is concerned with the number of people living in their town who support investments into transit infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be hypergeometric assuming that the shuffle algorithm does not play the same songs multiple times in a session. Here \\(N\\) is the total number of songs in the library, \\(M\\) is the number of songs which Charles considers to be favourites, and \\(n\\) is the number that Charles decides to listen to.\nAssuming that the carts are dealt without replacement this will be hypergeometric. There are \\(N=52\\) total cards, \\(M=13\\) spades, and then \\(n\\) will correspond to the size of the hand (such as \\(5\\) or \\(3\\) or \\(8\\)).\nThis will be hypergeometric, assuming that there is actually random attendance at the meetings. Here, \\(M\\) will correspond to the number of individuals who enjoyed the book, \\(N\\) is the total size of the book club, and \\(n\\) is the number of people who can attend any given meeting.\nIn order for this to be hypergeometric, we would need to assume that Sadie is able to tell apart the different swans, so as to not count them more than once. In this case, \\(M\\) is the total number of black swans at the sanctuary, \\(N\\) is the total number of swans at the sanctuary, and \\(n\\) is the number of swans that Sadie looks at.\nThis will typically be a hypergeometric, as most surveys are without replacement. Here, \\(N\\) is the size of the possible population of individuals being surveyed, \\(n\\) is the size of the survey, and \\(M\\) is the number of people in the town who support investments into transit infrastructure.",

    "text": "8.7 The Poisson Distribution\nThe hypergeometric strayed from the pattern of the previously introduced distributions by not being represented as a sequence of Bernoulli trials. However, it was still characterized by a sequence of repeated trials. While many statistical experiments can be framed in this way, there are of course processes which are not described by repeated trials. Consider, for instance, any process where something is observed for a set period of times and events may or may not occur during this interval. Perhaps you sit on the side of the road and count the number of cars traveling by a particular intersection over the course of an hour. Each car going by is an event, but in this setting, the number of events is the random quantity itself. None of the distributions discussed until this point are suited to this type of process.\nWhen we have events which occur at a constant rate, and our interest is in the number of events which occur, then we can make use of the Poisson distribution.16 The Poisson distribution takes a single parameter, \\(\\lambda\\), which is the average rate of occurrence of the events over the time period we are interested in. We write \\(X\\sim\\text{Poi}(\\lambda)\\). If \\(X\\sim\\text{Poi}(\\lambda)\\) then \\[p_X(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^x}{x!} & x \\geq 0 \\\\ 0 &\\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}\\] Moreover, \\(E[X]=\\lambda\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\lambda\\).17\n\nExample 8.12 (Charles’ Novella Mistakes) Charles has decided to write a short novella. Hard at work, the novella turns out to be \\(105\\) pages, at the time of completion. Charles sends a copy off to the printer excited to share it with Sadie. After printing, Charles realizes that the spellcheck on the program indicates that there is a total of \\(215\\) errors. Mortified that these were not corrected before handing it over to Sadie, Charles starts to work out just how bad the situation is likely to be.\n\nWhat is the average number of mistakes per page of the novella?\nWhat is the variance for the number of mistakes per page in the novella?\nWhat is the probability that there were no mistakes on the first page?\nWhat is the probability that there were five or more mistakes on the first page?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average there will be \\(\\dfrac{215}{105} = \\dfrac{43}{21}\\) errors per page. We can take the distribution to be \\(\\text{Poi}(\\dfrac{43}{21})\\).\nThe variance for a Poisson distribution is given by \\(\\lambda\\). Thus, it will be \\(\\dfrac{215}{105} = \\dfrac{43}{21}\\).\nHere we want \\(p_X(0)\\). This is given by \\[p_X(0) = \\frac{e^{-43/21}(43/21)^0}{0!} = e^{-43/21} \\approx 0.129.\\] Thus, there is about a \\(13\\%\\) chance that there are no errors on the first page.\nHere we want \\(P(X \\geq 5) = 1 - P(X &lt; 5) = 1 - (p_X(0) + p_X(1) + p_X(2) + p_X(3) + p_X(4))\\). Solving this directly gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(X \\geq 5) = 1 - P(X &lt; 5) &= 1 - \\sum_{x=0}^4 p_X(x) \\\\\n&= 1 - \\sum_{x=0}^4 \\frac{e^{-43/21}(43/21)^x}{x!} \\\\\n&\\approx 0.0571.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, there is just over a \\(5\\%\\) chance of there being \\(5\\) or more errors on the first page.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the most common applications for the Poisson distribution have to do with the occurrences of events throughout time, it is also possible to view this as the occurrences of events throughout space. For instance, if there is a manufacturer producing rope, then the number of defects in a set length of rope is likely to follow the Poisson distribution. Similarly, in a set geographic area, the number of birds of a particular species is likely to follow a Poisson distribution. For the Poisson distribution, we are typically thinking that there is a rate at which events of interest occur, and we can use the Poisson distribution to model the total number of occurrences over some specified interval.\n\nExample 8.13 (Charles and Sadie find Poisson Quantities) As the last named discrete distribution, Charles and Sadie are excitedly exploring quantities around them which may be explained by the Poisson distribution.\nFor each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a justification of why a Poisson distribution would (or would not be) appropriate, including a description of the parameter.\n\nCharles got a small injury which required a trip to the emergency room. While there, Charles begins to count the number of people that arrive over the course of the next hour.\nSadie, while out exploring birds, decides to count the number of cardinals in a particular good viewing spot which is about \\(100m^2\\) in size.\nCharles, while crocheting, realizes that sometimes the yarn in use has defects itself. Charles begins to think about the number of defects in \\(200\\) yards of yarn.\nCharles and Sadie are sitting at a public park overlooking the water. They start to count the number of boats that pass by over the course of the two hours they sit there.\nSadie starts a blog sharing recipes for baking vegan breads, and begins to consider the number of visitors that show up to the site each day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking \\(X\\) to represent the number of individuals arriving to the emergency room in the next hour, this will reasonably follow a Poisson distribution. The parameter \\(\\lambda\\) would represent the number of individuals who arrive per hour, on average. It is counting arrivals per hour.\nIf Sadie has a sense of the number of cardinals on average per \\(100m^2\\) area, then a Poisson will be appropriate, supposing that the birds are fairly uniformly spread out. The parameter \\(\\lambda\\) would be the average number of birds in that size of region. It is counting occurrences per area.\nIf Charles knows the average number of defects per \\(200\\) yards of yarn, then this value can be taken to be \\(\\lambda\\). Supposing that the defects occur uniformly, without dependence (e.g., one defect makes more likely around it) then a Poisson distribution is appropriate. It is counting defects per length of yarn.\nWe would take \\(\\lambda\\) to represent the average number of boats in a two hour period passing by the location that they are sitting. Supposing that these happen independently, at roughly uniform rates, then a Poisson is likely appropriate. This would be counting arrivals per (two) hour(s).\nIf Sadie gets a measure of the average number of visitors per day to the website, then setting this to be \\(\\lambda\\) gives a reasonable representation of traffic patterns. We would likely want to assume that the arrivals are not more on some days (for instance, the weekends) than others, but under these assumptions having \\(X \\sim \\text{Poi}(\\lambda)\\) is likely reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.7.1 The Poisson Process\nOne particularly useful feature of the Poisson distribution stems from the fact that, when events of interest occur at a constant rate overtime, we can find a relevant Poisson distribution to describe these occurrences. When we model events in this manner, we refer to it as a Poisson process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Poisson Process\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(X\\) counts the number events over a period of time of length \\(t\\). Further suppose that:\n\nEvents at interest happen at a constant rate overtime. Denote the rate as \\(\\alpha\\) (per unit time).\nEvents occur independently of one another, so that the occurrence of one event does not influence any others.\nNo two events occur at precisely the same time.\n\nThen, the number of events that occur during the time interval \\(t\\), \\(X\\), are said to follow a Poisson process. Specifically, \\(X\\) will follow a \\(\\text{Poi}(\\alpha t)\\) distribution.\n\n\nThe utility of the Poisson process is that, supposing we can determine the average rate of occurrence for any events, and supposing that we are willing to make the independence and non-simultaneous assumptions for the process, the distribution of events will always be Poisson. For instance, if we know how many events occur per hour and want to know how many events will occur per year, so long as the assumptions still hold, we can scale up the rate of occurrences and continue to use a Poisson distribution. For this reason, the Poisson distribution is frequently deployed for modelling real-world phenomenon.\n\nExample 8.14 (Sadie’s Vegan Bakery Aspirations) With the success of Sadie’s vegan baking blog, there is some excited chatter about the prospects of opening up a real-world bakery! Before committing to this investment, Sadie wants to have an idea of whether the bakery would really be sustainable, and if so, what the staffing needs would be. Based on Sadie’s market research, it is expected that \\(168\\) customers would arrive per week.\n\nWhat assumptions would Sadie need to make in order to model this as a Poisson process? Is this likely to be accurate in actuality?\nSadie figures that it is important to bake everything fresh each day. If the bakery would be open 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, on average how many customers are expected to show up each day?\nIf each customer purchases 2 items on average, what is the probability that Sadie sells out on a day if each morning \\(50\\) items are baked?\nSadie is very concerned about the impact of waste on a successful business. Write an expression for the probability that Sadie has a certain amount of waste (\\(w\\)) given the preparation of \\(n\\) baked good at the start of each day. Assume that customers purchase 2 items on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSadie would need to be willing to assume that customers arrive at a constant rate overtime (throughout all hours of the day, days of the week, weeks of the year), that customer arrivals are independent of each other (one customer arriving does not impact any other customer arriving), and that no two customers arrive at precisely the same time. These are not very reasonable assumptions in practice. It is very likely that certain times of the day or certain days of the week would be more (or less) popular than others. Moreover, it seems likely that people may arrive in groups, violating the independence assumption.\nIf we make the assumptions regarding the Poisson process, then we know that the arrival rate, \\(\\alpha\\), is \\(168\\) per week. A day is \\(8\\) hours, out of the full \\(56\\) available, and so it corresponds to \\(t = \\dfrac{1}{7}\\). Thus, we know that the number of customers arriving per day will follow a \\[\\text{Poi}(\\frac{1}{7}\\times 168) = \\text{Poi}(24),\\] distribution, and as such the expected number of customers will be \\(24\\).\nThe number of purchases made by a customer is \\(2\\). As a result, the number of purchases per day will be \\(2\\times 24 = 48\\). As a result, we can model the number of daily purchases as a \\(\\text{Poi}(48)\\) distribution. If we want to know what the probability that Sadie sells out, we want to know \\[P(X \\geq 50) = 1 - P(X &lt; 50) = 1 - \\sum_{x = 0}^{49} \\frac{(48)^xe^{-48}}{x!}.\\] Using a computer to calculate this gives 0.4054.\nIf Sadie prepares \\(n\\) items, and wants to know the probability of having a certain amount of waste \\(w\\) (\\(w \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n\\}\\)), this can be analyzed using the same \\(\\text{Poi}(48)\\) from the previous part. Specifically, taking \\(X\\) to be the number of items sold in a day, then Sadie will be \\(w\\) waste if \\(n - X = w\\), or equivalently \\(X = n + w\\). Thus, \\[P(W = w) = P(X = n + w) = \\frac{(48)^{n+w}e^{-48}}{(n+w)!},\\] for \\(w = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}\\). The probability that there is no waste, is \\[P(W = 0) = P(X \\geq n) = 1 - \\sum_{x = 0}^{n-1}\\frac{(48)^{x}e^{-48}}{x!}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that a Poisson process can be defined over space as well, not just time. For instance, if we know that errors occur in the manufacturing of a particular chemical at a rate of \\(1\\) per kiloliter, then the number of errors when producing any volume of the chemicals will also follow a Poisson process. It is most common to discuss the units as events per time, but every other unit will function in the exact same manner.\n\n\n8.7.2 The Poisson Approximation to the Binomial\nThe Poisson distribution and binomial distribution may appear, on the surface, to be fairly disconnected from one another. The binomial distribution counts the number of successes in a discrete number of trials, where the number of trials is known in advance. The Poisson distribution, on the other hand, counts the number of events that occur not on repeated trials, but from a set window of observation. Both distributions are counting the number of occurrences of an event within a fixed observation window, but under very different circumstances.\nConsider, however, what would happen if you began to perform more and more trials in a binomial experiment, with each of these trials getting closer and closer together. Intuitively, as this happens, the statistical experiment at hand begins to look more and more like the continual observation of a process. Consider, for instance, rolling a die every second and watching for when a certain outcome is observed. What if instead of once per second the die were rolled \\(100\\) times per second? At some point, the individual experiments in the binomial experiment begin to blend together into a continuous process. At this point, the binomial and the Poisson distribution seemingly intersect: in each, you are observing a process in continuous time, counting the number of events that occur.\nThis intuition turns out to be correct. The Poisson distribution can be thought of as the limiting distribution to the binomial distribution. This can be formalized mathematically in the following manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimiting Case of the Binomial\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(X \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, \\dfrac{\\lambda}{n})\\), with \\(E[X] = \\lambda\\), and probability mass function \\[p(x) = \\binom{n}{x}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^x\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^{n-x}.\\] Then, \\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} p(x) = \\frac{\\lambda^{x}e^{-\\lambda}}{x!},\\] which is the probability mass function for a \\(\\text{Poi}(\\lambda)\\) random variable.\n\n\nNote that in order for the limiting behaviour of this to hold the binomial requires both \\(n\\to\\infty\\) as well as \\(p\\to 0\\) at such a rate so that \\(np = \\lambda\\) is constant. If this happens then in the limit the two distributions exactly coincide. While it is unlikely to perform a binomial experiment with infinite trials and a shrinking success probability, we may be faced with binomial distributions that have fairly high \\(n\\) and fairly low \\(p\\), and in these cases, we can use the Poisson to approximate binomial probabilities.18 In order to do so we say that if \\(X \\sim \\text{Binom}(n, p)\\) then \\(X \\dot\\sim \\text{Poi}(np)\\), where \\(\\dot\\sim\\) is read “is approximately distributed according to”.\nThe main utility of the approximation is that, especially for large \\(n\\), binomial probabilities can be challenging to compute owing to the need to calculate \\(\\dbinom{n}{x}\\). Poisson probabilities are comparatively straightforward, and as such, when a rough calculation is all that is required, they can work fairly well.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: This plot demonstrates the convergence of the Binomial to the Poisson (in terms of probability mass function) as \\(n\\) increases and \\(p\\) decreases, holding \\(np\\) constant. The red circles show the Poisson probabilities, and the sequence of blue shapes show several binomial distributions, with increasing \\(n\\), that are progressively better approximated by the Poisson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.15 (Charles’ Viral Trick-Shot Attempt) Charles has been watching online videos of seemingly impossible “trick shots”, where individuals toss household objects to land in increasingly complex locations. Inspired by this trend, Charles decides to try a version of this at home, where the goal is to bounce a dime off of the table and have it land in an upright coke bottle. Suppose that the probability that Charles succeeds on any given attempt of this trick shot is \\(0.01\\).\n\nIf Charles attempts the trick shot \\(100\\) times, what is the probability that at least one of the attempts is successful?\nHow can the probability in part (a) be approximated using a Poisson? How close is the approximation.\nSuppose that Charles instead attempts a new, more challenging the trick shot \\(1000\\) times. This shot has a success probability of just \\(0.001\\). What is the approximate probability that more than one of these attempts are successful?\nDo you expect that the probability in (b) or (c) will be closer to the truth? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of successes will follow a \\(\\text{Bin}(100, 0.01)\\). We want to know \\(P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\\), and so we can compute this by calculating \\[P(X = 0) = \\binom{100}{0}(0.01)^{0}(0.99)^{100} = 0.99^{100}.\\] As a result, the probability of at least one success is \\(1 - 0.99^{100}\\) or approximately 0.634.\nThe binomial can be approximated using a \\(\\text{Poi}(100(0.01)) = \\text{Poi}(1)\\) distribution. In this case, \\[P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) \\approx 1 - \\frac{e^{-1}1^0}{0!} = 1 - e^{-1} \\approx 0.632.\\] This approximation differs from the truth by 0.0018471.\nThis binomial can be approximated using the same \\(\\text{Poi}(1)\\) distribution, since \\(1000(0.001) = 1\\). As a result, the approximate probability will still be \\(1 - e^{-1} \\approx 0.632\\).\nThe probability in (c) should be closer to the truth since \\(n\\) is larger and the approximation is based on the limit as \\(n\\to\\infty\\). Thus, for larger \\(n\\) with constant \\(np\\), the approximation should improve. Indeed, if we check the actual binomial probability in the second case we get 0.6323046 which differs from the approximation by just 0.0001840164.",

    "text": "8.8 Using Named Distributions\nWhile many other named, discrete distributions exist, these are the most common. When confronted with a problem in the real-world for which you wish to understand the uncertainty associated with it, a reasonable first step is to determine whether a named distribution is well-suited to representing the underlying phenomenon. Is it a situation with enumerated events which are equally likely? Use the discrete uniform. Is it a binary outcome? Use the Bernoulli. Are you counting the number of success in a fixed number of trials? Use the binomial. Are you running repeated trials until a (certain number of) success(es)? Use the geometric (or negative binomial). Are you sampling without replacement? Use the hypergeometric. Are you counting events over a fixed space? Use the Poisson.\nOnce identified, the distribution can be used in exactly the same way as any probability mass function. That is, we still require all the probability rules, event descriptions, and techniques from before. The difference in these cases is that we immediately have access to the correct form of the probability mass function, the expected value, and the variance.\nAn additional utility with this approach to solving probability questions is that, over time and repeated practice, you can build an intuition as to the behaviour of random variables following these various distributions. Probabilities in general can be deeply unintuitive. It can be hard to assess, without formally working it out, whether an event is likely or unlikely, let alone how likely an event is. However, the lack of intuition from our wider experience can be negated almost entirely by building of intuition through the repeated application of these distributions. You can start to gain a sense of how binomial random variables behave, being able to determine just from inspection whether events seem plausible or not. Much of the study of probability and statistics is about building a set of tools that can overcome the flaws in our intuitive reasoning regarding uncertainty. This comes only through practice, however, this framework of named distributions provides a very solid foundation to perform such practice.\n\n8.8.1 Named Distributions in R\nIn R all of the named distributions that we have discussed, and in fact, many that we have not discussed, are implemented to make calculations easier. In particular, there are R functions which evaluate the probability mass function for the various distributions. Alongside these, there are also functions which calculate what we refer to as the cumulative probability19, which is to say the \\(P(X\\leq k)\\) for some value \\(k\\). These functions generally are called d{distname}, where {distname} is the name of the relevant distribution. For instance, dbinom for the binomial, dpoi for the Poisson, and so forth. These will evaluate the probability mass function at the relevant values. In order to evaluate the cumulative probability at the specified values you would call p{distname}. These functions take in a parameter for the value to evaluate at, and then parameters that correspond to the various parameters from the distributions themselves.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that we have seen the sample function before, which is an implementation of the discrete uniform. To implement the Bernoulli, we can use the binomial distribution with \\(n=1\\). It is a worthwhile exercise to see if you can use R to start answering the questions from this chapter, numerically. This is the first prominent use case for R programming which can save a tremendous amount of time, and is likely the first use case that becomes directly relevant to the course material.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "9.1 Continuous Versus Discrete\nOur discussions of probability distributions and their summaries have focused entirely on discrete random variables. To recap, a discrete random variable is any random numeric quantity that can take on a countable number of values. Discrete random variables are defined in contrast to continuous random variables, which take on values over the span of intervals in uncountably large sets. Suppose that \\(X\\) can take any real number between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). There is no way to enumerate the set of possible values for this random quantity, and so it must not be discrete.\nMany quantities of interest are better treated as a continuous quantity rather than a discrete one even when this is not technically correct. For instance, time measured in seconds is often best thought of as continuous, even though any stop watch used to grab these measurements will have some limit to the precision with which they can measure. Similarly, lengths and heights will often be better treated as continuous quantities, even though any measuring device will necessarily have some minimal threshold after which it cannot discern distances. Thus, deciding whether a quantity is continuous or discrete is sometimes a judgment call. In general discrete quantities are harder to work with when the set of possibilities is very large. In these cases, not much is lost by treating the random variables as though they were continuous. This distinction is another area which requires the active development of intuition, but once present, the distinctions become second nature.1\nDistinguishing whether a random quantity is continuous or discrete is crucial as, broadly speaking, the two types of quantities are treated differently. The same underlying ideas are present, but the distinctions between the two settings require some careful thought. The use of continuous random variables necessitates an understanding of introductory calculus. These course notes are designed to be understood without any experience in calculus, and as a result, we will first present continuous random variables in general, without the need for calculus. Additional sections containing the technical details follow. Despite requiring calculus to be complete understood, continuous random variables are the dominant type of random variables outside of introductory courses. As a result, understanding the distinctions, and becoming familiar with how they are to be manipulated is an important skill.\nThe key difference between discrete and continuous random variables is that, for discrete random variables the behaviour is governed by assessing \\(P(X=x)\\) for all possible values of \\(x\\), while for continuous random variables \\(P(X=x)=0\\) for every value of \\(x\\). This is likely a surprising statement, and as such it is worth reiterating. With discrete random variables we discussed how all of the probabilistic behaviour is governed by the probability mass function. This is defined as \\(p_X(x) = P(X=x)\\). If \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable, we must have \\(P(X=x) = 0\\). Correspondingly, continuous random variables do not have probability mass functions, and to understand the behaviour of these random variables we must us other quantities.",

The nature of a continuous random variable is such that there is no possible way to enumerate all of the values that are possible to be realized by the random quantity. Suppose that we take a set of countably many possible observations and gave each of these a probability of greater than \\(0\\) of occurring. Even if we take an infinite number of them, there will still be an uncountably infinite number of events in the sample space that we have not accounted for. We know that the total probability of the sample space must be \\(1\\), and so we must have the total probability of the first set of events being less than \\(1\\)2.\nNow suppose we take another set of countably many events, again giving each of them a positive probability. Once more the sum of all of these probabilities must be less than \\(1\\), and specifically, the sum of both sets must also be less than \\(1\\). Even after these two sets, there are still uncountably infinite events to go and so we continue this process. Because we always need the total probability to be \\(1\\) once all events have been accounted for, and because we will always have uncountably infinite events remaining to account for, we can never have a positive probability assigned to each event in a set of events. Even if we made the probability of each of these sets very, very small3 after some fixed number of countable events the probabilities would be greater than \\(1\\), which cannot happen. As such, each event itself must have \\(0\\) probability.\nAn alternative technique for understanding this intuition is to think about how unlikely it really would be to observe any specific value. Suppose that \\(X\\) takes values on the interval \\([0,1]\\). Recall that, when we defined probabilities, we discussed them as being the long run proportion of time that an event occurs. Take some event, say \\(X=0.5\\). Suppose that we took repeated measurements of \\(X\\) which are independent and identically distributed. Now suppose that at some point we exactly do observe \\(X=0.5\\). Should we expect that this will ever happen again? The next time we get near \\(0.5\\), might we instead observe \\(0.51\\) or \\(0.49\\) or \\(0.5000000000000000001\\) or any of the other uncountably infinite values in the very near vicinity of \\(0.5\\)? Each time that we make an observation the denominator of our proportion is growing, but if every value between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) is truly possible, as time goes on the number of times that \\(X=0.5\\) must stay much, much smaller than the total number of trials. If we continue this off to infinity, in the limit, the probability must become \\(0\\).\nThis conclusion leads to a few different points. First, impossibility is not the same as probability \\(0\\). Impossible events do have probability \\(0\\), but possible events may also have probability \\(0\\). Events which are outside of the sample space are impossible. Events inside the sample space, even probability zero events, remain possible. Second, we require alternative mathematical tools for discussing the probability of events in a continuous setting. Ideally this would be analogous to a probability mass function, but would somehow function in the case of continuity.",

    "text": "9.2 Cumulative Distribution Functions\nTo begin building to the continuous analogue of the probability mass function, we will start by focusing on events that are easier to define in the continuous case. Suppose that \\(X\\) is defined on some continuous interval. Instead of thinking of events relating to \\(X=x\\), we instead turn our focus to events of the form \\(X \\in (a,b)\\) for some interval defined by the endpoints \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Now note that, relying only on our knowledge of probabilities relating to generic events, we can rewrite \\(P(X\\in(a,b))\\) slightly. Specifically, \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(X\\in(a,b)) &= 1 - P(X\\not\\in(a,b))\\\\\n&= 1 - P(\\{X &lt; a\\}\\cup\\{X &gt; b\\}) \\\\\n&= 1 - \\left(P(X &lt; a) + P(X &gt; b)\\right)\\\\\n&= 1 - P(X &gt; b) - P(X &lt; a)\\\\\n&= P(X &lt; b) - P(X &lt; a).\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: A number line showcasing the interval \\((a,b)\\) and demonstrating how you can take everything less than \\(b\\) and remove all that is less than \\(a\\) to be left with only \\((a,b)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn words we know that the probability that \\(X\\) falls into any particular interval is given by the probability that it is less than the upper bound of the interval minus the probability that it is less than the lower bound of the interval. Notice that \\(X &lt; a\\) is an event, and if we knew how to assign probabilities to \\(X&lt;a\\) for arbitrary \\(a\\), then we could assign probabilities to any interval. Also note that, even in the continuous case, it make sense to talk of \\(P(X &lt; a)\\) for some value \\(a\\). These intervals will contain an uncountably infinite number of events, and as such, can certainly occur with greater than \\(0\\) probability.\nConsider an example with \\(X\\) defined on \\([0,1]\\). In this case we know that \\(P(X&lt;1)=1\\). Note that we could have written \\(P(X \\leq 1) = 1\\), which may have been more obviously true. However, \\(P(X\\leq 1) = P(\\{X&lt;1\\}\\cup\\{X=1\\}) = P(X&lt;1) + P(X=1)\\) and we know that \\(P(X=1)=0\\). In the continuous case we do not need to worry whether we use \\(X\\leq a\\) or \\(X &lt; a\\), and we will interchange them throughout.\n\nExample 9.1 (Charles and Sadie Wait for the Bus) Charles and Sadie are visiting a large city and are getting around via public transit while there. They are not quite familiar with the bus schedules yet, but they know that the bus they are waiting for will show up sometime in the next \\(15\\) minutes. They realize that this is a continuous random quantity, and decide to pass the time by trying to reason about how long they will be waiting for the bus to arrive. To do so, they make the assumption that the bus is equally likely to show at any point during this interval.\n\nWhat is the probability that Charles and Sadie wait \\(15\\) or fewer minutes for the bus?\nWhat is the probability that Charles and Sadie wait \\(5\\) or fewer minutes for the bus?\nWhat is the probability that Charles and Sadie wait exactly \\(7\\) minutes for the bus?\nWhat is the probability that Charles and Sadie wait between \\(8\\) and \\(12\\) minutes for the bus?\nWhat is the probability that Charles and Sadie have to wait longer than \\(13\\) minutes for the bus?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(X\\) represent the amount of time that they wait for the bus.\n\nIf we trust their judgment, then they have claimed that they will wait between \\(0\\) and \\(15\\) minutes for the bus. As a result, \\(P(X \\leq 15) = 1\\).\nHere we can reason that if any time is equally likely for the bus to arrive, then the first \\(5\\) minutes must be as likely as the second interval of \\(5\\) minutes or the third. That is, in the first \\(5\\) minutes there is a total of \\(\\dfrac{5}{15} = \\dfrac{1}{3}\\) of the possible arrival times taken up, and so we must conclude that \\(P(X \\leq 5) = \\dfrac{1}{3}\\).\nThis would be \\(P(X = 7)\\). \\(X\\) is a continuous quantity, and so \\(P(X = 7) = 0\\).\nWe can reason through this in two different ways. First, we can use the property discussed above that \\(P(X \\in (8, 12)) = P(X \\leq 12) - P(X\\leq 8)\\), and then use the same procedure as in (b). That gives \\[P(X \\in (8, 12)) = \\dfrac{12}{15} - \\dfrac{8}{15} = \\dfrac{4}{15}.\\] Alternatively, because each interval of the same length must be equally likely, we can reason that this is just a length \\(4\\) interval. Thus, it must have the same likelihood as any other length \\(4\\) interval, given by \\(\\dfrac{4}{15}\\).\nNote that, longer than \\(13\\) is the complement to less than \\(13\\). Thus, \\[P(X \\geq 13) = 1 - P(X \\leq 13) = 1 - \\dfrac{13}{15} = \\dfrac{2}{15}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe centrality of events of the form \\(X \\leq a\\) prompts further consideration the cumulative distribution function (introduced in Definition 9.1).\n\nDefinition 9.1 (Cumulative Distribution Function) The cumulative distribution function of a random variable \\(X\\), typically denoted as \\(F(x)\\) or \\(F_X(x)\\), is defined as the function that gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to some threshold.\nThat is, \\(F_X(x) = P(X \\leq x)\\). We may also refer to the cumulative distribution function simply as the distribution function.\n\nOnce we have defined the distribution function for a random variable, using the above derivation we are able to determine the probability associated with any events based on intervals. The cumulative distribution function for continuous random variables is central to nearly every probability calculation that is performed. In the discrete case, since it is simply the summation of the probability mass function, it tends to be a less useful quantity.\nSuppose that, for a random variable \\(X\\), we know the cumulative distribution function. This knowledge permits the computation of any probability associated with the random variable. Consider some event defined in terms of \\(X\\) which we may wish to determine the probability of. We know that events are subsets of the sample space. Every one of these events can be written using our basic set operations (unions, intersections, and complements) applied to intervals of the form \\((a,b)\\) and sets of the form \\(\\{x\\}\\).4 The axioms of probability allow us to compute probabilities across the set operations. Further, our knowledge of the cumulative distribution function, the conversion of \\(P(X \\in (a,b))\\) into \\(F_X(b) - F_X(a)\\), and the fact that \\(P(X=x) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\) gives all of the results we need to derive probabilities for these events.\n\nExample 9.2 (Charles and Sadie’s Light Bulbs) Charles and Sadie decide that they need to replace some light bulbs. In their research online, a particular manufacturer of light bulbs, Bayesian Brights, lists the cumulative distribution function for the lifetime of their bulbs, in hours. The model Charles and Sadie are considering is said to have a lifetime (in hours) governed by \\[F_X(x) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{10000}\\right).\\]\n\nWhat is the probability that a purchased lightbulb lasts for less than \\(5000\\) hours?\nWhat is the probability that a purchased lightbulb lasts for between \\(7500\\) and \\(12000\\) hours?\nWhat is the probability that a purchased lightbulb lasts for more than \\(8000\\) hours?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the given cumulative distribution function this can be calculated as \\[P(X \\leq 5000) = F(5000) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{5000}{10000}\\right) = 1 - e^{-1/2} \\approx 0.39346934.\\]\nHere we get \\[\\begin{multline*}P(X \\in (7500,12000)) = P(X \\leq 12000) - P(X\\leq 7500) = F(12000) - F(7500) \\\\\n= \\exp\\left(-0.75\\right) - \\exp\\left(-1.2\\right) \\approx 0.171172341.\\end{multline*}\\]\nWe can convert this to be the complement event so that it is expressible in terms of the cumulative distribution function. That is, \\(P(X \\geq 8000) = 1 - P(X \\leq 8000)\\), and so \\[P(X \\geq 8000) = 1 - F(8000) = 1 - (1 - e^{-0.8}) = e^{-0.8} \\approx 0.449328964.\\]",

    "section": "9.3 The Probability Density Function",
    "text": "9.3 The Probability Density Function\nThe distribution function will be the core object used to discuss the probabilistic behaviour of a continuous random variable. All of the behaviour of these random quantities will be described by the distribution function, and as such we will take the distribution function as a function which defines the distribution of a continuous random quantity. This is all that we need in order to analyze these random variables, however, it may be a little unsatisfying in contrast with the discrete case.\nWe had set out to find a quantity that paralleled the probability mass function. Instead, we concluded that the cumulative distribution function can be made to play the same role in terms of describing the behaviour of the random quantity. Still, it may be of interest for us to have a function which takes into account the relative likelihood of being near some value. Suppose, for instance, that for a random variable defined on \\([0,1]\\) we wanted to know how likely it was to be in the vicinity of \\(X=0.5\\). We could take a small number, say \\(\\delta = 0.01\\) and calculate \\[P(X\\in(0.5-\\delta,0.5+\\delta)) = F(0.5+\\delta)-F(0.5-\\delta).\\] This is perfectly well defined based on our discussions to this point. Now, suppose that \\(\\delta\\) is small enough so that it is reasonable to assume that this probability is fairly evenly distributed throughout the interval. Then, if we wanted to assign a likelihood to each value, we could divide this total probability by the length of the interval, \\(2\\delta\\). As a result, in this case, the probability that \\(X\\) is nearly \\(0.5\\) will be approximately given by the expression \\[\\dfrac{F(0.5+\\delta)-F(0.5-\\delta)}{2\\delta}.\\]\nWe had taken \\(\\delta=0.01\\), but the same process could be applied for smaller and smaller \\(\\delta\\), say \\(0.001\\) or \\(0.0001\\). Intuitively, as the size of this interval shrinks more and more we are getting a better and better estimate for the likelihood that the random variable is in the immediate vicinity of \\(0.5\\). Moreover, as \\(\\delta\\) gets smaller and smaller our assumption of a uniform probability over the interval becomes more and more reasonable. Unfortunately, we cannot set \\(\\delta=0\\), exactly. We can ask what happens in the limit as \\(\\delta\\) continues to get smaller and smaller. This question is in the purview of calculus, and can in fact be answered. While working out the answer is beyond the scope of the course, we will provide the result anyway.5 The resulting function is called the probability density function, and is related to the cumulative distribution function through derivatives (and integrals).\n\nDefinition 9.2 (Probability Density Function) A random variable \\(X\\), with cumulative distribution function \\(F(x)\\), is further characterized by its probability density function, denoted \\(f(x)\\). The density function describes the relative likelihood of a random variable taking on values in a particular interval, and mirrors the behaviour of the probability mass function in the discrete case. Formally, the probability density function is equal to the derivative of the cumulative distribution function.\n\nRoughly speaking, the density function evaluates how likely it is for a continuous quantity to be in a small neighbourhood of the given value. Critically, probability density functions do not give probabilities directly. In fact, probability density functions may give values that are greater than \\(1\\)!6 Still, if we see the shape of the probability density function, we can state how likely it is to make observations near the results of interest. We will often graph the density functions. The high points of the graph indicate regions with more probability than the regions of the graph which are lower. Again, the specific probability of any event \\(X=x\\) will always be \\(0\\), but some events fall in neighbourhoods which are more likely to observe than others.7\n\nExample 9.3 (The Types of Busses in the City) After returning from their trip to the big city, Charles and Sadie are talking to their friend Garth, with a lot more experience in the matter. Garth explains that there are actually several different types of busses, with different arrival schedules over the \\(15\\) minute interval. Knowing that Charles and Sadie have started to learn about probability density functions, Garth draws out the following sketch, giving the probability density function for three different busses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the three buses is most likely to show up around the \\(1\\) minute mark?\nWhich of the three buses is most likely to show up around the \\(6\\) minute mark?\nWhich of the three buses is most likely to show up around the \\(14\\) minute mark?\nWhich bus is most likely to show up at \\(10\\) minutes exactly?\nDuring which intervals would each of the buses be more likely than the other two to arrive?\nDescribe the behaviour of each of the three buses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt \\(x = 1\\), the black density is higher than the red density which is higher than the blue density. This gives the relative ranking that arrivals around \\(1\\) minute or more likely for the black bus than red or blue.\nAt \\(x = 6\\), the blue density is higher than the red or black densities, which are roughly the same, and as such, it is the most likely bus to arrive in the vicinity of \\(6\\) minutes.\nAt \\(14\\), the red density is higher than the black density which is higher than the blue. This gives the relative ordering of likelihood of arrivals.\nAll buses have probability \\(0\\) of arriving at \\(10\\) minutes exactly since these are the densities for continuous random variables.\nThe black bus is most likely to arrive for times up until around \\(4\\) minutes, where the blue bus is then the most likely to arrive until around \\(11\\) minutes, where the red bus is most likely to arrive until the \\(15\\) minute mark.\nThe red bus has an equal probability of arriving across the full interval. The black bus is more likely to arrive near the start of the interval, slowly decaying in likelihood as time goes on, while remaining fairly likely at the \\(15\\) minute mark. The blue bus is very unlikely to take a very short period of time, or a very long period of time, and far more likely to sit in the middle of the possible interval.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormally, the probability of any event of interest, say \\(P(X \\in [a,b])\\) for some interval \\([a,b]\\), is given by the area under the probability density function. As a result, if the probability density function is plotted, then considering the area that is encompassed within any particular interval (or set of intervals) is equivalent to considering the probability that the random variable takes on a value in that range. This can be particularly useful when working with distributions and trying to get a sense of probabilities: drawing out the density function, and then highlighting the area of interest is an effective tool for understanding the probabilities that you are dealing with.\n\nExample 9.4 (Non-Uniform Bus Arrivals) After some further investigation, Charles and Sadie decide that the uniformly arriving buses are not actually uniformly arriving. Instead, there is a lower probability of arriving, which increases for the first two minutes, then a uniform probability for the next eleven minutes, followed by a decreasing probability for the final two minutes. Charles draws a rough sketch of the density function that is expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt what value is the uniform portion of the probability density function depicted?\nWhat is the probability that the bus arrives in the first two minutes?\nWhat is the probability that the bus arrives in the final four minutes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that the total probability must equal \\(1\\). Moreover, we know that the probability is given by the area under the curve. This area can be decomposed into two triangles, each with a base of \\(2\\) and an unknown height, \\(h\\), as well as a rectangle with a width of \\(11\\) and a height of \\(h\\). Thus, using geometric area formulae we get \\[1 = 2\\times\\frac{1}{2}\\times2\\times h + 11\\times h = 13h \\implies h = \\frac{1}{13}.\\] Thus, the height will be \\(\\dfrac{1}{13}\\).\nThe probability that the bus arrives in the first two minutes is the area under the curve between \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 2\\). This is given by a triangle with base \\(2\\) and height (from (a)) of \\(\\dfrac{1}{13}\\). Thus, the probability that the bus arrives in the first two minutes is \\(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\times2\\times\\dfrac{1}{13} = \\dfrac{1}{13}\\).\nThe probability that the bus arrives in the final four minutes is the same as the area under the curve between \\(x=11\\) and \\(x=15\\). This can either be computed as a trapezoidal area, or as the area of a rectangle plus that of a triangle. The triangle is equivalent to that computed for part (b), and the rectangle has a base of \\(2\\) and a height of \\(\\dfrac{1}{13}\\), so that total the area is \\[2\\times\\dfrac{1}{13} + \\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{3}{13}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.1 \\(\\int\\) The Formal Mathematics for Continuous Random Variables\nThe use and understanding of a continuous cumulative distribution function can be done completely without calculus. However, even while motivating the idea of a probability density function we leaned on the concept of limits. The connection between the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function, as well as the use of the probability density function for the computation of probabilities, fundamentally relies on a grasp of differential and integral calculus. Consider the example outlined above that \\(X\\) is near \\(0.5\\). We argued that the probability is approximately \\(2\\delta f(0.5)\\), where we defined \\[f(0.5) = \\lim_{\\delta\\to 0} \\frac{F(0.5+\\delta) - F(0.5-\\delta)}{2\\delta}.\\] This is precisely the first principles definition of a derivative, meaning that \\[f(0.5) = \\left.\\frac{d}{dx} F(x)\\right|_{x=0.5} = F'(0.5).\\]\n\nDefinition 9.3 (The Probability Density Function (Calculus)) The probability density function, denoted \\(f(x)\\), of a random variable \\(X\\) with cumulative distribution function \\(F(x)\\) is given by the first derivative of the cumulative distribution function, \\[f(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}F(x) = F'(x).\\]\n\nThe interpretation remains the same: the probability density function gives a rough idea of how likely events near the desired outcome will be, but does not itself give probabilities. In order to get specific probabilities from the probability density function, we need to use the area under the curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Probabilities with Probability Density Functions\n\n\n\nSuppose that we wish to calculate \\(P(X \\in (a, b))\\) for a continuous random variable \\(X\\) with probability density function \\(f(x)\\). This is given by \\[P(X \\in (a,b)) = \\int_{a}^b f(x)dx = F(a) - F(b),\\] where \\(F(x)\\) is the cumulative distribution function. Suppose that, instead of a single interval, we wish to know the probability that \\(A\\) occurs, where \\(A\\) is an event that is comprised of the union of many intervals, say \\[A = (a_1, b_1) \\cup (a_2, b_2) \\cup \\cdots \\cup (a_k, c_k).\\] In this case we can apply the axiom of additivity to give, \\[P(A) = \\int_{a_1}^{b_1}f(x)dx + \\int_{a_2}^{b_2}f(x)dx + \\cdots + \\int_{a_k}^{b_k}f(x)dx.\\]\n\n\nUsing the fact that a probability density function is integrated in order to derive probability expressions, we can discuss the required features for a probability density function to be valid. These properties stem, fundamentally, from the requirements (under the axioms of probability) that \\(P(E) \\geq 0\\) for all events and \\(P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of a Probability Density Function\n\n\n\n\nNon-negative: A valid probability density function, \\(f(x)\\), will be such that \\(f(x) \\geq 0\\) for all real-valued \\(x\\).\nIntegrate to One: A valid probability density function will be such that \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)dx = 1.\\]\n\n\n\nThese properties are analogous to the properties for a probability mass function, with one distinct difference: there is no requirement that the density function be less than or equal to \\(1\\). The rationale is that we require the complete area to be bounded above by \\(1\\) (in a property that is analogous to the sum-to-one constraint of probability mass functions), which occasionally results in probability density values above \\(1\\).\nGiven that the density function is the first derivative of the cumulative distribution function, we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to conclude that the cumulative distribution function must be derived by integrating the density function. We can see this by noting that \\(F(x) = P(X \\in (-\\infty, x))\\), which we stated was given by integrating the density over \\((-\\infty, x)\\).\n\nDefinition 9.4 (The Cumulative Distribution Function (Calculus)) The cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable, \\(X\\), computes the probability that \\(X\\) is less than or equal to a threshold value \\(x\\). This can be computed as \\[F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f(t)dt.\\]\n\n\nExample 9.5 (A More Complicated Density for the Bus) Charles and Sadie, while pleased with the added complexity afforded by the probability density function in Example 9.4, they are not sure that it is quite right. It seems that it is more likely that the bus arrives around the halfway point than it is at any other time throughout the interval. After playing around a bit, they propose the following curve, \\[f(x) = \\alpha\\left(\\frac{x}{15}\\right)^2\\left(1-\\frac{x}{15}\\right)^2, \\quad x \\in [0,15].\\] This curve seems to have a shape that better tracks the expected arrivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the value of \\(\\alpha\\) that renders this curve a valid probability density function?\nWhat is the probability that the bus arrives in the first two minutes?\nWhat is the probability that the bus arrives in the final four minutes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe require both that the density function integrates to \\(1\\) and that it is always positive. Note that as long as \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\), then \\(f(x) \\geq 0\\), and so we will restrict attention only to solutions where \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\). Beyond this, we require unit integration. That is, \\[\\begin{align*}\n1 &= \\int_{0}^{15} \\alpha \\left(\\frac{x}{15}\\right)^2\\left(1-\\frac{x}{15}\\right)^2dx \\\\\n&= 15\\alpha\\int_{0}^1 x^2(1 - x)^2dx \\\\\n&= 15\\alpha\\int_{0}^1 x^2(1 - 2x + x^2)dx \\\\\n&= 15\\alpha\\int_{0}^1 x^2 - 2x^3 + x^4dx \\\\\n&= 15\\alpha\\left[\\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{2} + \\frac{x^5}{5}\\right]_{x=0}^1 \\\\\n&= 15\\alpha\\left[\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{5}\\right] \\\\\n&= 15\\alpha\\frac{1}{30} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\\\\n\\implies \\alpha = 2.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe probabilities can then be derived by integrating the density over the given area. As an alternative solution, you can integrate the density to derive the cumulative distribution function, and then use this to solve for the probabilities. Both techniques are shown.\nTo find \\(F(x)\\), we take \\[\\begin{align*}\n     F(x) &= \\int_{0}^{x}  2\\left(\\frac{t}{15}\\right)^2\\left(1-\\frac{t}{15}\\right)^2dt \\\\\n     &= 30\\left[\\frac{t^3}{3} - \\frac{t^4}{2} + \\frac{t^5}{5}\\right]_{t=0}^{t=x/15} \\\\\n     &= 10\\left(\\frac{x}{15}\\right)^3 - 15\\left(\\frac{x}{15}\\right)^4 + 6\\left(\\frac{x}{15}\\right)^5.\n\\end{align*}\\] Then, if we wish to find \\[P(X \\leq 2) = F(2) = 10\\left(\\frac{2}{15}\\right)^3 - 15\\left(\\frac{2}{15}\\right)^4 + 6\\left(\\frac{2}{15}\\right)^5 = \\frac{4864}{253125}.\\]\nAlternatively, we could have solved \\[\\int_{0}^{2} 2\\left(\\frac{t}{15}\\right)^2\\left(1-\\frac{t}{15}\\right)^2dt = \\frac{4864}{253125},\\] directly, through the same integration steps outlined.\nWe can use the cumulative distribution function found previously, or else directly integrate. To directly integrate you would solve \\[\\int_{11}^{15} 2\\left(\\frac{t}{15}\\right)^2\\left(1-\\frac{t}{15}\\right)^2dt,\\] however, given that \\(F(x)\\) is known it is simpler to use that. This is given by \\[P(11 \\leq X \\leq 15) = F(15) - F(11) = 1 - F(11) = 1 - \\left(10\\left(\\frac{11}{15}\\right)^3 - 15\\left(\\frac{11}{15}\\right)^4 + 6\\left(\\frac{11}{15}\\right)^5\\right),\\] which gives \\[P(11 \\leq X \\leq 15) = \\frac{30848}{253125}.\\]",

    "section": "9.4 Using Continuous Distributions",
    "text": "9.4 Using Continuous Distributions\nWith the exception of the previously indicated differences, continuous and discrete random variables are treated similarly. The tools to analyze them differ8, but the fundamentals remain the same. It is possible to compute expected values, medians, and modes, with roughly the same interpretations. It is possible to describe the range, interquartile range, and variance, with similar interpretations. The axioms of probability still underpin the manipulation and analysis of these random variables. The distinction is merely that in, place of elementary mathematics to complete the calculations, calculus is required.\n\n9.4.1 \\(\\int\\) Differences in Working With Discrete and Continuous Random Variables\nMost of what was covered for discrete random variables will hold for continuous random variables as well, with the caveat that in the continuous case we replace summations with integrals. We have seen this to an extent already. In the discrete case, if a random variable \\(X\\) has probability mass function \\(p(x)\\), then \\(P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\sum_{x=a}^{b} p(x)\\). Similarly, in the continuous case, if the probability density function is \\(f(x)\\), then we write \\(P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\sum_{a}^b f(x)dx\\).\nThis holds across other defining identities as well, for instance discussing the expected value or variance of a random variable. It is worth highlighting the two major differences for working with continuous random variables once more. First, while in the discrete case we think predominantly of probabilities being defined on the singletons, with the probability mass function encoding \\(p(x) = P(X = x)\\), these probabilities are all zero for continuous random variables. We can make this argument more concretely now using our technique for calculating probabilities based on the density function, where \\[P(X = a) = P(a \\leq X \\leq a) = \\int_{a}^{a} f(x)dx = 0.\\] As a result, no matter the value or the random variable under consideration, we always know that \\(P(X = x) = 0\\) for continuous quantities.\nSecondly, the density function does not directly encode probabilities, and so can take on values greater than \\(1\\). As a result, when considering the validity of a probability density function we need to consider not the specific values of the density being bounded, but rather the entire range.9\nBeyond introductory courses and notes, it is quite common to discuss only continuous random variables. In areas where both discrete and continuous random variables are relevant, a common convention is to simply define the integral sign in such a way so as to read it as a summation if a discrete random variable is being used. That is, in reading beyond these notes you may have authors express \\(\\sum_{x=0}^5 p(x)\\) as \\(\\int_{0}^5 p(x)dx\\), where the summation is implied if \\(p(x)\\) characterizes a discrete distribution. In these notes we will continue separating out integrals and summations explicitly.\n\n\n9.4.2 \\(\\int\\) Calculating Expected Values for Continuous Random Variables\nUsing the convention that summations become integrals when moving from discrete to continuous random variables, we can introduce the idea of a continuous expected value.\n\nDefinition 9.5 (Expected Value (Mean) of a Continuous Random Variable) For a continuous random variable, \\(X\\), the expected value is interpreted as the center of mass of the distribution. Supposing that \\(X\\) has density function, \\(f(x)\\), then \\[E[X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty xf(x)dx.\\] When the random variable \\(X\\) is defined on a bounded support \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), the expected value can be equivalently written as the integral only over that support \\[E[X] = \\int_{\\mathcal{X}} f(x)dx.\\]\n\nBeyond the swapping of the summation for an integral, expected values behave equivalently whether the underlying distribution is discrete or continuous. That is, any of the properties relating to expected values can be written in terms of the expectation notation, \\(E[\\cdot]\\), with the relevant sum or integral being computed as required. The quantities are otherwise interpreted in the same manner as well. Notably, this means that the Law of the Unconscious Statistician holds in the continuous case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Law of the Unconscious Statistician\n\n\n\nThe law of the unconscious statistician (LOTUS) states that, for a random variable \\(X\\), if we wish to find \\(E[g(X)]\\), then we compute \\[E[g(X)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(x)f_X(x)dx.\\]\n\n\nUsing the continuous version of the LOTUS, we can define the following quantities which parallel their discrete counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Value of a Linear Transformation\n\n\n\nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are arbitrary real numbers then, \\[E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b.\\]\n\n\n\nDefinition 9.6 (Variance) The variance of a random variable, typically denoted \\(\\text{var}(X)\\), is given by the expected value of the squared deviations of a random variable from its mean. That is, \\[\\text{var}(X) = E\\left[(X - E[X])^2\\right].\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing the Variance\n\n\n\nThe variance of a random variable, \\(X\\), can be computed as \\[\\text{var}(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariance of a Linear Transformation\n\n\n\nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are arbitrary real numbers then, \\[\\text{var}[aX + b] = a^2\\text{var}(X).\\]\n\n\n\nDefinition 9.7 (Standard Deviation) The standard deviation of a random variable is the square root of the variance, which is to say \\[\\text{SD}(X) = \\sqrt{\\text{var}(X)}.\\]\n\n\nExample 9.6 (Charles and Sadie Potato Yield) Charles and Sadie have purchased a plot of land and they are looking to do some sustainable development of it. In their planning, they are looking at different crops that they could grow. Charles and Sadie decide that potatoes sound particularly fun, and do some research into the amount that they can anticipate from each plant. From their research they find that the probability density function for single plant potato yield (in pounds) is given by \\[f(x) = \\frac{25}{52}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right) \\quad x \\geq 0.\\]\n\nWhat is the expected yield, in pounds, for a single potato plant?\nWhat is the variance and standard deviation for the yield for a single potato plant?\nWhile Sadie is happy to work in pounds, Charles much prefers kilograms. Moreover, the yield given by the previous distribution function was over counting by \\(0.2\\)lbs per plant, since they had not considered the dirt that came with the harvest. What is the actual expected value, variance, and standard deviation for the total yield in kilograms (note, \\(1\\) kilogram is \\(2.2\\) pounds).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get the expected yield we find \\[E[X] = \\int_{0}^\\infty xf(x)dx = \\int_{0}^\\infty x\\frac{25}{52}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right)dx.\\] This can be solved via integration by parts as \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X] &= \\int_{0}^\\infty x\\frac{25}{52}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right)dx \\\\\n&= \\left[-x\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right)\\right]_{x=0}^\\infty + \\int_{0}^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right)dx \\\\\n&= 0+\\left[-\\frac{52}{25}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right)\\right]_{x=0}^\\infty \\\\\n&= \\frac{52}{25}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFor the variance, we can use the fact that \\(\\text{var}(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2\\). Note that \\(E[X^2]\\) can be computed in much the same way as \\(E[X]\\), requiring two applications of integration by parts, \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[X^2] &= \\int_{0}^\\infty x^2\\frac{25}{52}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right)dx \\\\\n&= \\left[x^2\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right)\\right]_{x=0}^\\infty + 2\\int_{0}^\\infty x\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right) \\\\\n&= 2\\int_{0}^\\infty x\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right) \\\\\n&= 2\\times\\frac{52}{25}\\times\\int_{0}^\\infty x\\frac{25}{52}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{104}{25}\\times E[X] \\\\\n&= \\frac{104}{25}\\times\\frac{52}{25}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, \\[\\text{var}(X) = \\frac{104}{25}\\times\\frac{52}{25} - \\left(\\frac{52}{25}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{52}{25}\\right)^2.\\] As a result, \\(\\text{SD}(X) = E[X] = \\frac{52}{25}\\).\nIf \\(X\\) is the weight in pounds, then the new weight will be \\[Y = frac{(X - 0.2)}{2.2} = \\frac{1}{2.2}X - \\frac{1}{11}.\\] Then, we can apply the linear transformation theorems to get \\[E[Y] = \\frac{1}{2.2}E[X] - \\frac{1}{11} = \\frac{47}{55}.\\] Similarly, we have \\[\\text{var}(Y) = \\frac{1}{2.2^2}\\text{var}(X) = \\frac{2704}{3025}.\\] This leads to a standard deviation of \\[\\text{SD}(X) = \\frac{52}{55}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3 \\(\\int\\) Calculating Percentiles for Continuous Random Variables\nIn the same way that expected values generalized from the discrete to the continuous case, so too will percentiles.\n\nDefinition 9.8 (Percentiles) The \\(100p\\)th percentile, is denoted \\(\\zeta(p)\\) and is the value such that \\(P(X \\leq \\zeta(p)) = p\\). Thus, the median is given by \\(\\zeta(0.5)\\) and is also called the \\(50\\)th percentile.\n\nA key distinction between percentiles in discrete case as compared to the continuous case is that, in the discrete case, it was often not possible to find \\(\\zeta(p)\\) such that \\(P(X \\leq \\zeta(p)) = p\\) held exactly. Instead, we found \\(\\zeta(p)\\) such that \\(P(X \\leq \\zeta(p)) \\geq p\\) and \\(P(X \\geq \\zeta(p)) \\geq p\\). In the continuous case, this is not typically required. This gives two (equivalent) techniques for solving for a given percentile using continuous distributions. If the cumulative distribution function, \\(F(x)\\), is known then \\(\\zeta(p) = F^{-1}(p)\\).10\nAlternatively, we can work from the density function directly and solve the integral equation, \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\zeta(p)} f(x)dx = p,\\] for \\(\\zeta(p)\\). Doing so implicitly works out the cumulative distribution function as an intermediate step, however, there are cases where there is no closed-form solution for the cumulative distribution function but this technique can still be used.\nGiven the definition of a percentile in the continuous case, we can introduce both the median and the interquartile range as being exactly analogous to the quantities in the discrete case.\n\nDefinition 9.9 (Median (Continuous)) The median of a distribution is the \\(50\\)th percentile, \\(\\zeta(0.5)\\). That is, the median \\(m\\) is the value such that \\(P(X \\leq m) = 0.5\\).\n\n\nDefinition 9.10 (Interquartile Range (IQR)) The interquartile range, or IQR, is defined as \\(\\zeta(0.75) - \\zeta(0.25)\\), the difference between the third and first quartiles. It is a measure of spread, and is typically denoted as \\(\\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1\\), where \\(Q\\) stands for quartiles.\n\n\nExample 9.7 (Median Potato Yield) Still interested in the potatoes that they could grow on their land, Charles and Sadie want to further investigate what they should expect for the potatoes that they grow. While they now understand the mean and variance, they figure that it is probably worth understanding the median and interquartile range as well, as this may give a better capacity to plan for the best and worst case scenarios. Suppose that the probability density function for single plant potato yield (in pounds) is given by \\[f(x) = \\frac{25}{52}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right) \\quad x \\geq 0.\\]\n\nWhat is the median yield for a single potato plant?\nWhat is the interquartile range for the yield of a single potato plant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the median we need to solve \\(F(x) = 0.5\\) for \\(x\\). We could do this direct from the integral, or by first finding the cumulative distribution function. We will first find the cumulative distribution function to ease the efforts required for the interquartile range calculation. Note that \\[F(x) = \\int_{0}^x \\frac{25}{52}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25t}{52}\\right)dt = \\left[-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{25t}{52}\\right)\\right]_{t=0}^{x} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right).\\] Then, we get \\[\\begin{align*}\n0.5 &= 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right) \\\\\n0.5 &= \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right) \\\\\n\\log(0.5) &= -\\frac{25x}{52} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{52}{25}\\log(2) \\\\\n&\\approx 1.442.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe IQR first requires Q1 and Q3. Thus, we solve these in the same way as above. In fact, for general percentile we get \\[\\begin{align*}\np &= 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right) \\\\\n1-p &= \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25x}{52}\\right) \\\\\n\\log(1-p) &= -\\frac{25x}{52} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{52}{25}\\log(\\frac{1}{1-p}).\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, we have \\[\\text{IQR} = \\frac{52}{25}\\log(\\frac{1}{0.25}) - \\frac{52}{25}\\log(\\frac{1}{0.75}) \\approx 2.2851.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.4 The Named Continuous Distributions\nJust as with discrete distributions, there are named continuous distributions. These are typically governed by either a density function or cumulative distribution function, alongside the expected value and variance. Just like the named discrete distributions, by matching the underlying scenario to the correct process we are able to avoid a lot of work in understanding the behaviour of the random quantities. Now, because calculus is not assumed knowledge, we will not work too widely with continuous random variables. We will introduce several named continuous distributions: the uniform distribution11, the normal distribution,12 as well as the \\(t\\), exponential and gamma distributions.13",

On this interval, equal probability density is given to every event, which is to say that the density function is constant.

    "title": "9  Continuous Random Variables",
    "section": "9.6 The Normal Distribution",
    "text": "9.6 The Normal Distribution\nThe normal distribution, also sometimes referred to as the Gaussian distribution, is a named continuous distribution function defined on the complete real line. The distribution is far and away the most prominently used distribution in all of probability and statistics. In fact, most people have heard of normal distributions even if they are not aware of this fact. Any time that there is a discussion of a bell curve, for instance, this is in reference to the normal distribution. Normally distributed quantities arise all over the place from measurements of heights, grades, or reaction times through to levels of job satisfaction, reading ability, or blood pressure. There is a tremendous number of normally distributed phenomena naturally occurring in the world, which renders the normal distribution deeply important across a wide range of domains.\nPerhaps more important than the places where the normal distribution arises in nature are the places where it arises mathematically. Later in these notes we will see a result, the central limit theorem, which is one of the core results in all of statistics. Much of the statistical theory that drives scientific inquiry sits atop the central limit theorem. And at the core of the central limit theorem is the normal distribution. It is virtually impossible to overstate the importance of the normal distribution, and as a result, it is worthy of investigation.\n\n9.6.1 The Specification of the Distribution\nA normal distribution is parameterized by two parameters: the mean, \\(\\mu\\), and the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). We write \\(X\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\). These parameters directly correspond to the relevant quantities such that \\(E[X] = \\mu\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\sigma^2\\). The density function is given by \\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right).\\] This can be quite unwieldy to work with, however, when it is plotted we see that the normal distribution takes on a bell curve which is centered at \\(\\mu\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Three normal distribution densities plotted with mean 0 (red and blue), and mean 5 (black). The red density has variance 1, the blue density has variance 4, and the black density has variance 0.25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.6.2 The Standard Normal Distribution\nNormally distributed random variables are particularly well-behaved. One way in which this is true is that if you multiply a normally distributed random variable by a constant, it will remain normally distributed, and if you add a constant to a normally distributed random variable, it will remain normally distributed. Consider, for \\(X\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), taking the \\(X - \\mu\\). From our discussions of expected values we know that \\(E[X-\\mu] = E[X]-\\mu = 0\\). Furthermore, adding or subtracting a constant will not change the variance. Thus, \\(X-\\mu\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\).\nNow, consider dividing this by \\(\\sigma\\), or equivalently, multiply by \\(\\dfrac{1}{\\sigma}\\). The expected value of the new quantity will be \\(\\dfrac{1}{\\sigma}\\times 0 = 0\\), and, from our discussions regarding the variance of linear transformations, the variance of the new quantity will be \\(\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\times\\sigma^2 = 1\\). Taken together then, if \\(X\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), \\[Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\sim N(0,1).\\] This holds true for any normal distribution with any mean or variance values. This straightforward transformation allows us to discuss normal distributions in terms of \\(N(0,1)\\). We call this the standard normal distribution, and will typically use \\(Z\\) to denote a random variable from the standard normal distribution.\n\nDefinition 9.11 (Standard Normal Distribution) The standard normal distribution is the version of the normal distribution with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(1\\). We say that \\(Z\\) follows a standard normal, and write \\(Z\\sim N(0,1)\\), if the density of \\(Z\\) is given by \\[f_Z(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right).\\] We denote the density of \\(Z\\) as \\(\\varphi(z)\\), and the cumulative distribution function of \\(Z\\) as \\(\\Phi(z)\\). The cumulative distribution function, \\(\\Phi(z)\\), does not have a nice form to be written down, however, it is a commonly applied enough function that many computing languages have implemented it, including of course R.17\n\nThe utility in this process of converting normally distributed random variables to be standard normal random variables, a process known as standardization, is demonstrated by realizing that events can be converted using the same transformations. Specifically, suppose we have \\(X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), and we want to find \\(P(X \\leq x)\\). Note that, \\(X \\leq x\\) must also mean that \\[\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\leq \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma},\\] through an application of the same transformation to both sides. But we know that the left hand side of this inequality is exactly \\(Z\\), a standard normal random variable with cumulative distribution function \\(\\Phi(z)\\). Thus, \\[P(X \\leq x) = P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right).\\] Using this trick of standardization any normal probability can be converted into a probability regarding the standard normal.\n\nExample 9.9 (Charles and Sadie Explore House Plants) Charles and Sadie learn that the heights of fully grown house plants are often normally distributed. They are exploring which plants will work best in their new apartment, but are finding it difficult to reason about them in comparison to one another. Some plants end up being taller on average with a lot more variability, while others may be shorter but far more certain. Sadie realizes that the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal, \\(\\Phi(z)\\), can be evaluated using their smart phones. As a result, they get to work expressing different probabilities in terms of \\(\\Phi(z)\\).\nThey are comparing four different plant species. These species have heights according to the following random variables.\n\nPlant \\(A\\) has height \\(X\\), which follows a normal distribution with mean \\(90\\) and variance \\(100\\).\nPlant \\(B\\) has height \\(Y\\), which follows a \\(N(110, 400)\\) distribution.\nPlant \\(C\\) has height \\(V\\), which follows a normal distribution centered on \\(70\\) with standard deviation \\(7\\).\nPlant \\(D\\) has height \\(W\\), which follows a normal distribution with \\(\\mu=85\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 = 81\\).\n\nExpress each of the following probabilities in terms of \\(\\Phi(z)\\), the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable.\n\nOne spot the plants cannot be too tall. What is the probability that they can fit plant \\(A\\) into a spot which cannot accommodate plants taller than \\(80\\)cm?\nA second spot would be strange to have too short of a plant in. If they require the plant to be at least \\(125\\)cm, what is the probability they can use plant \\(B\\)?\nA third spot can accommodate plants that are either under \\(60\\)cm if they use a stand, or else over \\(90\\)cm. How likely is it that plant \\(C\\) will work in this spot?\nA fourth spot requires a plant that is somewhere between \\(80\\)cm and \\(90\\)cm. What is the probability that plant \\(D\\) will work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we wish to standard a \\(N(90, 100)\\) random variable. To do this we note that \\[\\frac{X-90}{\\sqrt{100}} = \\frac{X - 90}{10} \\sim N(0,1).\\] Thus, taking \\(Z \\sim N(0,1)\\), we know that \\[P(X \\leq 80) = P\\left(\\frac{X - 90}{10} \\leq \\frac{80 - 90}{10}\\right) = P(Z \\leq -1) = \\Phi(-1).\\]\nHere we wish to standard a \\(N(110, 400)\\) random variable. To do this we note that \\[\\frac{Y-110}{\\sqrt{400}} = \\frac{Y - 110}{20} \\sim N(0,1).\\] Thus, taking \\(Z \\sim N(0,1)\\), we know that \\[P(Y \\geq 125) = P\\left(\\frac{Y - 110}{20} \\geq \\frac{125 - 110}{20}\\right) = P(Z \\geq \\frac{3}{4}) = 1 - \\Phi(0.75).\\]\nHere we wish to standard a \\(N(70, 49)\\) random variable. To do this we note that \\[\\frac{V-70}{7} \\sim N(0,1).\\] Thus, taking \\(Z \\sim N(0,1)\\), we know that \\[P(V \\leq 60) = P\\left(\\frac{V - 70}{7} \\leq \\frac{60 - 70}{7}\\right) = P(Z \\leq -\\frac{10}{7}) = \\Phi(-\\frac{10}{7}).\\] Moreover, we know that \\[P(V \\geq 90) = P\\left(\\frac{V - 70}{7} \\geq \\frac{90 - 70}{7}\\right) = P(Z \\geq \\frac{20}{7}) = 1 - \\Phi(\\frac{20}{7}).\\] Thus, the probability this will be acceptable will be \\(1 - \\Phi(\\frac{20}{7}) + \\Phi(-\\frac{10}{7})\\).\nHere we wish to standard a \\(N(85, 81)\\) random variable. To do this we note that \\[\\frac{W-85}{\\sqrt{81}} = \\frac{W - 85}{9} \\sim N(0,1).\\] Thus, taking \\(Z \\sim N(0,1)\\), we know that \\[\\begin{multline*}P(80 \\leq W \\leq 90) = P\\left(\\frac{80 - 85}{9} \\leq \\frac{W - 85}{9} \\leq \\frac{90 - 85}{9}\\right) \\\\ = P(Z \\leq \\frac{5}{9}) - P(Z \\leq -\\frac{5}{9}) = \\Phi(\\frac{5}{9}) - \\Phi(-\\frac{5}{9}).\\end{multline*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, combining our knowledge of continuous random variables, with the process of standardization we are able to calculate normal probabilities for any events relating to normally distributed random quantities. Moreover, since the shape of the normal distribution is so predictable, it is often easy to draw out the density function, and indicate on this graphic the probabilities of interest, which in turn helps with the required probability calculations. Calculating probabilities from normal distributions remains a central component of working with statistics and probabilities beyond these notes. Developing the skills and intuition at this point, through repeated practice is a key step in successfully navigating statistics here and beyond.\nWhen you have access to a computer, and your interest is in calculating a normal probability, as described above, there is not typically a need for standardization. However, it remains an important skill for several reasons. First, by always working with the same normal distribution, you will develop a much more refined intuition for the likelihoods of different events. It goes beyond working with the same family of distributions, you get very used to working with exactly the same distribution. Second, you will likely become quite familiar with certain key critical values of the standard normal distribution. These values arise frequently, and allow you to quickly approximate the likelihood of different events. Finally, as we begin to move away from studying probability and into studying statistics, the standard normal will feature prominently there.\n\n\n9.6.3 The Empirical Rule and Chebyshev’s Inequality\nAnother way in which the normal distribution is well behaved is summarized in the emprical rule. The shape of the distribution is such that, no matter the specific mean or variance, all members of the family remain quite similar. This enables the derivation of an easy, approximate result, to help intuitively gauge the probabilities of normal events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Empirical Rule\n\n\n\nThe empirical rule is a mathematical result regarding the probability of a normally distributed random variable. If \\(X\\) has a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), then:\n\nThe probability of observing a value within \\(\\sigma\\) of the mean is approximately \\(0.68\\);\nThe probability of observing a value within \\(2\\sigma\\) of the mean is approximately \\(0.95\\); and\nThe probability of observing a value within \\(3\\sigma\\) of the mean is approximately \\(0.997\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn words, the empirical states that almost all of the observations from a normal distribution will fall in the interval \\(\\mu\\pm3\\sigma\\). In mathematical terms, the empirical rule is summarized as \\[\\begin{align*}\n    P(\\mu-\\sigma\\leq X \\leq \\mu + \\sigma) &\\approx 0.68 \\\\\n    P(\\mu - 2\\sigma \\leq X \\leq \\mu + 2\\sigma) &\\approx 0.95 \\\\\n    P(\\mu - 3\\sigma \\leq X \\leq \\mu + 3\\sigma) &\\approx 0.997.\n\\end{align*}\\] With the standard normal we can replace \\(\\mu\\) with \\(0\\), and \\(\\sigma\\) with \\(1\\) to get a version which is slightly more concise to state. It is then possible to combine these different intervals by recognizing the symmetry in the normal distribution. That is, \\(P(\\mu \\leq X \\leq \\mu + \\sigma) \\approx \\dfrac{0.68}{2} = 0.34\\).\n\nExample 9.10 (Charles and Sadie Can Never Have Enough House Plants) Their standardization efforts paid off, and Charles and Sadie found some plants that should fit the spaces that they need once they’ve grown up. Because of how well the plants worked out, they wanted to buy some more. They end up back at the store, and they know that they need to get a plant that will grow to be between \\(70\\)cm and \\(106\\)cm. They have several options for plants again:\n\nA plant with heights \\(X\\) according to \\(N(88, 36)\\).\nA plant with heights \\(Y\\) according to \\(N(124, 324)\\).\nA plant with heights \\(W\\) according to \\(N(82, 144)\\).\n\nUnfortunately, Charles and Sadie forget their phones at home and so they cannot make direct calculations using \\(\\Phi(z)\\). Can you help them, without using a normal probability calculator, determine which plant has the highest probability of being acceptable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout access to \\(\\Phi(z)\\) we can instead make use of the empirical rule. Consider that for \\(X\\) we have \\(\\mu_X = 88\\) and \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{36} = 6\\).\n\nIf we take the interval \\([70, 106]\\) then we can consider the terms \\[\\frac{70-88}{6} = \\frac{-18}{6} = -3 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{106-88}{6} = 3.\\] Thus, \\(P(70 \\leq X \\leq 106) = P(\\mu_X - 3\\sigma_X \\leq X \\leq \\mu_X + 3\\sigma_X)\\). Using the empirical rule we know that this probability is approximately \\(0.997\\).\nWe can approach the same tactics for \\(Y\\). This time, we get \\[\\frac{70-124}{\\sqrt{324}} = -3 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{106-124}{18} = -1\\]. Thus, \\(P(70 \\leq Y \\leq 106) = P(\\mu_Y - 3\\sigma_Y \\leq Y \\leq \\mu_Y - \\sigma_Y)\\). Note that from \\(\\mu\\) to \\(\\mu-3\\sigma\\), according the empirical rule, there is \\(\\dfrac{0.997}{2} = 0.4985\\) probability. Similarly, according to the empirical rule there is \\(\\dfrac{0.68}{2} = 0.34\\) probability of being between \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\mu-\\sigma\\). Thus, if we take \\(0.4985 - 0.34 = 0.1585\\), this gives the probability of being between \\(\\mu-3\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu-\\sigma\\), as required.\nAs above, \\[\\frac{70-82}{\\sqrt{144}} = -1 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{106-82}{12} = 2\\]. As a result, \\(P(70 \\leq W \\leq 106) = P(\\mu_W - \\sigma_W \\leq W \\leq \\mu_W + 2\\sigma_W)\\). Note that as in (2) there is \\(0.34\\) probability of being between \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\mu-\\sigma\\). To be between \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\mu + 2\\sigma\\) there will be probability \\(\\dfrac{0.95}{2} = 0.475\\). As a result, the total probability here will be \\(0.34 + 0.475 = 0.815\\).\n\nAs a result, the first plant has a \\(0.997\\) chance to fit, the second a \\(0.1585\\), and the third a \\(0.815\\) (approximately).\n\n\n\n\nThe empirical rule is not exact, and when computing probabilities with access to statistical software it is likely of limited direct utility. However, it is another tool to leverage to continue refining your intuition for the behaviour of random quantities. It is also a good “check” to have, giving an immediate sense of the likelihood of different events. If you compute an answer which seems to contradict the empirical rule, take a second look. If you have someone tell you that they have observed events which are out of line with the empirical rule, be skeptical.\nThe empirical rule is a useful result to aid in building intuition regarding the normal distribution. However, when quantities are not normally distributed, it does not apply. A related, though somewhat weaker result is Chebyshev’s Inequality. This will hold for any distribution, and can be seen as a useful extension to the empirical rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChebyshev’s Inequality\n\n\n\nChebyshev’s Inequality provides probabilistic bounds on the likelihood of deviating from the mean for any random variable. In words, there is a probability of \\(0.75\\) or more of observing an observation within two standard deviations, and a probability of at least \\(0.8889\\) of observing a value within three standard deviations of the mean. Formally, for any \\(k &gt; 0\\), \\[P(\\mu - k\\sigma \\leq X \\leq \\mu + k\\sigma) \\geq 1 - \\frac{1}{k^2}.\\]\n\n\nHere \\(k\\) can be any real number which is greater than \\(0\\). If \\(k\\leq 1\\), this result is uninteresting since the bound simply is \\(0\\). However, taking \\(k=2\\) gives the \\(0.75\\) lower bound outlined above, which is a more useful result. Additionally, there is no requirement for \\(k\\) to be an integer here, and so, for instance, the probability of observing a value within \\(\\mu\\pm\\sqrt{2}\\sigma\\) is at least \\(0.5\\), for all distributions.\n\nExample 9.11 (Fitting in the Strange Plants) Charles and Sadie selected a plant to fit in the spot requiring one between \\(70\\) and \\(106\\)cm. However, as they are checking out at the store they see a plant that they like much better. They are conflicted since they do not know whether this plant will satisfy normality assumptions in its height. The worker tells them that on average the plant grows to be \\(88\\)cm, and figures that the variance will be approximately \\(51.84\\). Charles and Sadie want to be at least \\(90\\%\\) certain that the plant will fit. If they are, they will buy it!\n\nIf they assume that the plants heights are normally distributed, should they buy the plant?\nIf they do not assume that the plants heights are normally distributed, should they buy the plant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in this case, we have a mean of \\(88\\) and a standard deviation of \\(7.2\\). As a result, we have that \\(70\\) is \\(\\mu - 2.5\\sigma\\) and \\(106\\) is \\(\\mu + 2.5\\sigma\\). The empirical rule does not tell us directly how to address probabilities in this case, however, we know that \\[P(X \\in [\\mu-2\\sigma, \\mu+2\\sigma]) \\leq P(X \\in [\\mu - 2.5\\sigma, \\mu+2.5\\sigma]) \\leq P(X \\in [\\mu-3\\sigma,\\mu+3\\sigma]).\\] According to the empirical rule then we can say that, if this plant follows a normal distribution, the probability it is accessible will be between \\(0.95\\) and \\(0.997\\). If the normal distribution is a reasonable assumption, then they should buy the plant.\nIf the distribution is non-normal, then we can instead apply Chebyshev’s inequality. Here we have \\(k=2.5\\), as solved for in (a). As a result, \\[P(\\mu - 2.5\\sigma \\leq X \\leq \\mu + 2.5\\sigma) \\geq 1 - \\frac{1}{(2.5)^2} = 0.84.\\] As a result, if they want to be \\(90\\%\\) certain, without knowing more about the distribution they should not purchase the plant.",

    "text": "9.7 Closure of the Normal Distribution\nWe have seen a certain type of closure property for the normal distribution when we discussed standardization. That is, adding and multiplying by constants does not change the distribution when working with normally distributed quantities. This is an interesting property which does not hold for most distributions, and makes normally distributed random variables quite nice to work with. The normal distribution has an additional type of closure property which is frequently used.\nSuppose that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, with \\(X\\sim N(\\mu_X, \\sigma_X^2)\\), and \\(Y\\sim N(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y^2)\\). In this setting, \\[X+Y\\sim N(\\mu_X+\\mu_Y, \\sigma_X^2 + \\sigma_Y^2).\\] That is to say, the addition of two independent normally distributed random variables will also be normally distributed. This extends beyond two in the natural way, simply by applying and reapplying the rule (as many times as is required).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosure of the Normal Distribution\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) are all independent, with each \\(X_i \\sim N(\\mu_i, \\sigma_i^2)\\).

    "section": "9.8 Approximations Using the Normal Distribution",
    "text": "9.8 Approximations Using the Normal Distribution\nA final utility to the normal distribution is in its ability to approximate other distributions. While several of these approximations exist, we will focus on the normal approximation to the binomial as an illustrative example. Historically, these approximations were critical for computing probabilities by hand in a timely fashion. Owing to the widespread use of statistical software, these use cases are more and more limited. However, there are two major advantages to learning these approximations. First, with an approximation it becomes easier to leverage the intuition you will build regarding the normal distribution in order to better understand the behaviour of other random quantities. Second, the normal approximation has the same flavour as many results in statistics, and so it presents an additional path to familiarity with these types of findings.\nSuppose that \\(X\\sim\\text{Bin}(n,p)\\). Through knowledge of the binomial distribution, we know that \\(E[X] = np\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = np(1-p)\\). If \\(n\\) is sufficiently large then it is possible to approximate a binomial distribution using a normal distribution with the corresponding mean and variance. That is, for \\(n\\) large enough, we can take \\(X\\sim\\text{Bin}(n,p)\\) to have approximately the same distribution as \\[W\\sim N(np, np(1-p)).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: A plot showing the probability mass function of a \\(\\text{Bin}(100, 0.25)\\) distribution, with a \\(N(25, 18.75)\\) density overlaid, demonstrating the utility of the approximation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne consideration that we need to make when applying this approximation has to do with the fact that the normal distribution is continuous while the binomial distribution is discrete. As a result, the normal distribution can take on any value on the real line, where the binomial is limited to the integers. A question that we must answer is what to do with the non-integer valued numbers. The natural solution is to rely on rounding. That is, for any value between \\([1.5, 2.5)\\) we would round to the nearest integer, which is \\(2\\).\n\nDefinition 9.12 (Continuity Correction) The continuity correction is a technique for adjusting the probabilities computed using a continuous approximation to a discrete random variable. The correction relies on rounding non-integer values, which may be observed with regards to the continuous random variable, to the corresponding integer values for the discrete random variable that is being approximated.\n\nThis natural solution is in fact a fairly useful technique, and it is the one that we will make use of in the normal approximation. While rounding is quite natural, the process for leveraging this idea in probability approximation is somewhat backwards. That is, we typically will need to go from probabilities relating to \\(X\\) and transform those into probabilities relating to \\(W\\). So, for instance, if we wish to know \\(P(X \\leq 2)\\), then we need to be able to make this a statement regarding the random variable \\(W\\). In order to do this we need to ask “what is the largest value for \\(W\\) that would get rounded to \\(2\\)?” The answer is \\(2.5\\) and so \\(P(X \\leq 2) \\approx P(W \\leq 2.5)\\).\nA similar adjustment would be required if we instead wanted \\(P(X \\geq 5)\\). Here we would ask “what is the smallest value for \\(W\\) which would get rounded to \\(5\\)?” and note that the answer is \\(4.5\\). Thus, \\(P(X \\geq 5) \\approx P(W \\geq 4.5)\\). Once we have expressed the probability of interest in terms of the normal random variable, we can use the standard techniques previously outlined to compute the relevant probabilities. It is very important to note that these two results are of the form \\(X \\geq x\\) and \\(X \\leq x'\\). If we instead had considered \\(X &gt; x\\) or \\(X &lt; x'\\), we would need to take an additional step.\nFor continuous random variables whether \\(X \\geq x\\) or \\(X &gt; x\\) is considered makes no difference. However, for discrete random variables this is not the case. As a result we should first convert the event the an equivalent event which contains the equality sign within the inequality, and then apply the continuity correction. That is, if we want \\(P(X &gt; 3)\\) first note that for \\(X &gt; 3\\) to hold, we could equivalently write this as \\(X \\geq 4\\). Alternatively, if the event of interest is \\(X &lt; 8\\), this is the same as \\(X \\leq 7\\).\n\nExample 9.12 (Charles and Sadie Payouts over a Year) Charles and Sadie are back sitting at the coffee shop, reflecting on all of the probability that they have learned since their games began. They realize that each time they play the game to see who will pay, that is a Bernoulli trial with \\(0.5\\) probability. As a result, over the course of the year, if they go \\(200\\) times to get coffee, the number of times each of them will have to pay is governed by a \\(\\text{Bin}(200, 0.5)\\) random variable. Charles realizes that this is infeasible to work with a binomial distribution, and so seeks another way.18 Sadie suggest that they could use the normal approximation to the binomial.\n\nWhat is the approximate probability that Charles pays more than \\(115\\) times in a year, expressed in terms of \\(\\Phi\\).\nWhat is the approximate probability that Sadie will pay between \\(86\\) and \\(107\\) times? Explain how this can be approximated numerically.\nGive an upper and lower bound that both Charles and Sadie can be \\(95\\%\\) sure they will pay between (that is, two numbers such that the probability they pay at least the lower and at most the upper bound is \\(0.95\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFor these questions we will take \\(X \\sim \\text{Bin}(200, 0.5)\\), and therefore, \\(X \\dot\\sim W \\sim N(100, 50)\\). Thus, to calculate these probabilities, we can use normal approximations, making sure to apply the continuity corrections.\n\nWe want \\(P(X &gt; 115)\\). This is the same as asking \\(P(X \\geq 116)\\), and with the continuity correction, \\(P(X \\geq 116) \\approx P(W \\geq 115.5)\\). Thus, we take \\[P(W \\geq 115.5) = P\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{115.5 - 100}{\\sqrt{50}}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(2.192\\right).\\] This could be worked out using a normal probability calculator.19\nWe want \\[P(86 &lt; X &lt; 107) = P(87 \\leq X \\leq 106 \\approx P(87.5 \\leq W \\leq 106.5).\\] Note that if we consider \\[\\frac{106.5 - 100}{\\sqrt{50}} = 0.919 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{87.5 - 100}{\\sqrt{50}} = -1.838.\\] If we wanted to get a rough approximation of this, we could say that, from the empirical rule, the probability that \\[\\begin{multline*}P(\\mu_W - 1.838\\sigma_W \\leq W \\leq \\mu_W + 0.919\\sigma_W) \\leq P(\\mu_W - 2\\sigma_W \\leq W \\leq \\mu_W + \\sigma_W) \\\\\n= \\frac{0.68}{2} + \\frac{0.95}{2} = 0.815.\\end{multline*}\\] Note that this gives an upper bound on the probability. We could also get a lower bound on the probability by moving in the other directions, \\[P(\\mu_W - 1.838\\sigma_W \\leq W \\leq \\mu_W + 0.919\\sigma_W) \\leq P(\\mu_W - 2\\sigma_W \\leq W \\leq \\mu_W) = \\frac{0.95}{2} = 0.475.\\] This gives a fairly wide range, but we can be relatively confident it will be a lot closer to \\(0.815\\) than to \\(0.475\\), since the values are a lot close to \\(-2\\) and \\(1\\) than \\(-1\\) and \\(0\\).20\nNote that, if we use a normal approximation and the empirical rule, we know that there is approximately a \\(0.95\\) probability that a random variable falls within \\(2\\sigma\\) of the mean. The mean of \\(W\\) is \\(100\\) and \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{50}\\), so we can take the interval \\([85.8578, 114.1421]\\). Note that if we widen this slightly the probability will increase slightly, so that the probability \\(W \\in [85.5, 114.5]\\) must be greater than \\(0.95\\). The quantity \\(P(85.5 \\leq W \\leq 114.5)\\) corresponds to \\(P(86 \\leq X \\leq 114)\\), and so we can say that Charles and Sadie can each be roughly \\(95\\%\\) confident that they will need to pay between \\(86\\) and \\(114\\) times.21\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it is not necessary, it rarely makes sense to use an approximation. There will be cases where the approximation is directly useful, and in those moments it is great to be able to use it. This example of using the normal distribution to approximate a discrete random variable serves as a nice bridge from the study of probability to the study of statistics. In statistics we take a different view of the types of problems we have been considering to date, and we require the tools of probability that have been brought forth. As a result, a deep comfort with manipulating probability expressions is required to build a strong foundation while studying statistics.",

    "text": "9.9 The \\(t\\) Distribution\nThe \\(t\\) distribution, or Student’s \\(t\\) distribution named after the individual who popularized the distribution,22 is a bell-shaped distribution, not unlike the normal. It is parameterized by a single parameter, typically denoted \\(\\nu\\) and referred to as the degrees of freedom of the distribution.\nWhile it has a similar shape to the normal distribution, the \\(t\\) distribution has heavier tails than the normal, which is to say that the probability of observing an extreme event is larger in the \\(t\\) than in the normal. The \\(t\\) distribution is always centered at \\(0\\). Neither the probability density function nor the cumulative distribution function are particularly nice,23 however, the mean, median, and mode are all \\(0\\). The variance of the \\(t\\) distribution is only properly defined for \\(\\nu &gt; 2\\), and in this case if \\(X \\sim t_{\\nu}\\) then \\[\\text{var}(X) = \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu - 2}.\\]\nThe parameter \\(\\nu\\) is any real, positive number. Typically, \\(\\nu\\) is restricted to be a positive integer, for reasons that will become clear later. As \\(\\nu\\) increases, the tails of the \\(t\\) distribution become smaller and smaller. In the limit, as \\(\\nu\\) tends towards \\(\\infty\\), the \\(t\\) distribution approaches the standard normal. In fact, when \\(\\nu \\geq 30\\), the two distributions are nearly identical.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: The \\(t\\) distribution compared with the standard normal. As the degrees of freedom increasing, the density function for the \\(t\\) becomes closer and closer to the standard normal’s density function, and at \\(\\nu = \\infty\\) they theoretically overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that, compared with the normal distribution, the \\(t\\) distributions (particularly with lower degrees of freedom) are more likely to observe extreme events. Based on the empirical rule, we know that the probability of observing an event outside of \\(\\pm 3\\) on the standard normal is \\(0.3\\%\\). This is incredibly rare. By contrast, a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(2\\) degrees of freedom has a 9.55% chance of observing a value outside of the interval \\(\\pm 3\\). When it is said that the \\(t\\) distribution has heavier tails, this is what is meant.\n\nExample 9.13 (Characterizing Scale Errors) Charles and Sadie have been using a new kitchen scale to weigh the vegetables that they have started to grow in their garden. They are trying to keep a detailed log of the counts and weights of all the vegetables that they harvest so that they may know what works and what does not. Unfortunately, they realize that the scale that they are using is not perfectly accurate and seems to be introducing random errors. They begin to investigate these errors.\n\nSuppose that, by repeatedly weighing a reference weight, they determine that the mean error is equal to \\(0\\) and the variance is equal to \\(1\\). If the errors are normally distributed, approximately how likely is it that Sadie and Charles observe an error that is greater than \\(2\\) grams?\nSadie and Charles are skeptical of the normality of the errors. They suspect that perhaps the variance they measured was incorrect, and should have actually been \\(2\\). If this is the case, what is the corresponding \\(t\\) distribution that would be valid?\nIf the errors truly follow the \\(t\\) distribution from part (b), is it more or less likely that Sadie and Charles will observe an error greater than \\(2\\) grams, compared with (a)? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven their findings this will follow a \\(N(0, 1)\\) distribution. By the empirical rule, we know that approximately \\(95\\%\\) of observations will fall within \\(\\pm 2\\) standard deviations of the mean, which in this case is \\(1\\) gram. Thus, they should observe errors that are smaller than \\(2\\) in magnitude \\(95\\%\\) of the time, which means the probability of observing an error larger than this is approximately \\(0.05\\).\nIf instead they are faced with a \\(t\\) distribution, if the variance \\(2\\), then the number of degrees of freedom can be solved for by taking \\[2 = \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu - 2} \\implies \\nu = 4.\\] As a result, based on their measured results this would suggest a \\(t_4\\) distribution.\nIf the true error distribution is \\(t_4\\), then it is more likely to observe extreme values since the tails of the \\(t\\) distribution are heavier than the tails of the normal distribution. Using the computer to estimate this probability gives 0.1161, which is quite a lot larger than the \\(0.05\\) from (a).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(t\\) distribution, with its close connections to the normal distribution, will often arise in statistical applications. While less central than the normal, the \\(t\\) distribution is nevertheless very important for statistical analyses, and will be explored in more depth in the second part of these notes.",

    "text": "9.10 The Exponential Distribution\nThe exponential distribution is a single-parameter, skewed distribution that is always positive. The distribution has a probability density functioned supported on \\([0,\\infty)\\), which exhibits exponential decay over this interval, meaning that extreme events are possible, but fairly unlikely. The probability density function is characterized by a single parameter referred to as the rate, and is typically denoted using \\(\\lambda\\). Thus, if \\(X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)\\), then \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable with probability density function given by \\[f(x) = \\lambda\\exp(-\\lambda x), \\ x \\in [0,\\infty).\\] The cumulative distribution function for the exponential can be obtained through integration of the density, resulting in \\[F(x) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda x).\\] Moreover, if \\(X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)\\), then \\(E[X] = \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda}\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\).24\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: The exponential distribution shown for decreasing values of \\(\\lambda\\). Note that as the rate decreases, the mean increases. As a result, at this resolution, the curve will appear to flatten out. This has the effect of making larger events increasing likely, while decreasing the relative likelihood of small events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.14 (Charles and Sadie Install Solar Panels) Charles and Sadie are considering purchasing solar panels for a plot of land they wish to develop. The manufacturer of the solar panels suggests that the panels are exponentially distributed with a mean lifetime of 15 years.\n\nWhat is the variance in the expected lifetime of these panels?\nWhat is the probability that the panels will need to be replaced in less than \\(10\\) years?\nWhat is the probability that the panels last at least \\(20\\) years before needing to be replaced?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean lifespan is \\(15\\) and so we must have that \\(\\lambda = \\dfrac{1}{15}\\). Thus, \\(X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\dfrac{1}{15})\\), and \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\dfrac{1}{225}\\).\nThis is \\[P(X \\leq 10) = F(10) = 1 - \\exp(-\\dfrac{10}{15}) =  1 - \\exp(-2/3) \\approx 0.48658.\\]\nThis is \\[P(X \\geq 20) = 1 - F(20) = 1 - (1 - \\exp(-\\dfrac{20}{15})) = \\exp(-4/3) \\approx 0.26360.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.10.1 The Memoryless Property of the Exponential Distribution\nThe exponential distribution has one particularly important property that makes it a mathematically convenient model, while often challenging its validity for real-world applications. Specifically, the exponential distribution exhibits a memoryless property.25 The memoryless property states, roughly, that if you observe a process that is exponentially distributed before an event has been observed, the remaining time until an event will by exponentially distributed with the same parameter, with the current time being counted as zero. That is, the process seems to not have any memory of the elapsed duration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Memoryless Property of an Exponential\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)\\). Then, for any real numbers \\(t \\geq s \\geq 0\\), \\[P(X \\geq t | X \\geq s) = P(X \\geq t - s).\\] In this way, the elapsed time does not impact future probabilities, as the process “forgets”.\n\n\nSuppose that the lifespan of an electrical component is thought to be exponentially distributed with parameter \\(\\lambda\\). Then, we could work out the probability that the component lasts at least \\(10\\) years to be \\(1 - F(10) = \\exp(-10\\lambda)\\). However, suppose that we knew that the component had already been in service for \\(8\\) years. Given this information, we can conclude that the probability that the component will last another \\(10\\) years, is \\[P(X \\geq 18 | X \\geq 8) = P(X \\geq 18-8) = P(X \\geq 10) = \\exp(-10\\lambda).\\] Thus, if we know the component has been in service for \\(10\\) years and is still functioning, then it will be equally likely that it will last to \\(18\\) years as it was to have lasted to \\(10\\) from the start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof of the Memoryless Property\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the memoryless property can be proved using our standard notions of joint and conditional probabilities. Specifically, suppose that \\(X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)\\), and take the event \\(A\\) to be \\(\\{ X \\geq t \\}\\) and the event \\(B\\) to be \\(\\{X \\geq s \\}\\), for \\(t \\geq s\\). Thus, if \\(A\\) occurs then we know that \\(B\\) also occurs, since \\(t \\geq s\\), and as such we have that \\(A\\cap B = A = \\{X \\geq t\\}\\). Thus, \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(X \\geq t | X \\geq s) &= \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\exp(-t\\lambda)}{\\exp(-s\\lambda)} \\\\\n&= \\exp(-(t-s)\\lambda) \\\\\n&= P(X \\geq t - s).\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.15 (Charles and Sadie Consider Used Solar Panels) Charles and Sadie, in doing research on solar panels, are considering going the route of purchasing used solar panels instead of the new ones. The two options in front of them are to go with the new solar panels with a mean lifetime of \\(15\\) years, or purchase the used panels instead. When they were manufactured, the panels had an anticipated lifespan of \\(18\\) years, but they have been in service (and are still functioning) for a total of \\(12\\) years so far.\n\nWhich is more likely: that the new solar panels will last \\(15\\) years or that the used solar panels will last to a total of \\(27\\) years, given the current status?\nIs the exponential distribution likely to be reasonable for this setting? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that \\(P(X \\geq 15) = 1 - F(15) = 1 - (1 - \\exp(-15/15)) = \\exp(-1)\\). Thus, there is a probability of approximately \\(0.3679\\) that the new panels will last for \\(15\\) years. Using the memoryless property we can work out the probability for the used panels. \\[P(X' \\geq 27 | X' \\geq 12) = P(X' \\geq 27-12) = P(X' \\geq 15).\\] Since the used panels have a mean of \\(18\\), the rate will be \\(\\dfrac{1}{18}\\), and so the probability is \\(\\exp(-\\dfrac{15}{18}) \\approx 0.4346\\). Thus, it is more likely that the used panels survive to \\(27\\) than the new panels surviving to \\(15\\), given that we have observed the new panels functioning at \\(12\\) years.\nThe exponential distribution is likely not appropriate in this case, owing to the memoryless property. Specifically, it seems unlikely that a panel that has been in use for \\(15\\) years will continue functioning for an additional \\(15\\) years with the same probability as it was to hit \\(15\\) years in the first place. We know that as panels are in use, they are likely suffering ongoing deterioration from exposure, just simply through use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.10.2 The Exponential Distribution and Poisson Processes\nThe exponential distribution is closely related to the Poisson distribution through the Poisson process (recall Section 8.7.1 for the definition of the Poisson process). In particular, recall that in a Poisson process we are counting the number of events that occur over a particular interval. We concluded that the number of events, under the assumptions of the Poisson process, that occur during a set interval will follow a particular Poisson distribution. The exponential distribution arises in this context as the distribution for the interarrival times. That is, the number of events that occur during an interval will follow a Poisson distribution, however, the time between any two consecutive events will follow an exponential distribution, with the same rate parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Interarrival Times for a Poisson Process\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(X\\) follows a Poisson process with rate \\(\\alpha\\). Then the time between any two successive events will be distributed according to a \\(\\text{Exp}(\\alpha)\\) distribution.\n\n\n\nExample 9.16 (Sadie’s Vegan Bakery Aspirations: Revisited) Sadie has continued to consider the prospect of opening up a vegan bakery. Market research continues to suggest that it is expected that \\(168\\) customers would arrive per week, supposing that Sadie’s bakery was open \\(8\\) hours a day, \\(7\\) days a week.\n\nHow long (in hours) should Sadie expect to wait before the first customer arrives?\nHow long (in hours) should Sadie expect to wait between the 99th and 100th customer arrivals?\nSuppose that Sadie was having a particularly slow start to the day, and it had been \\(45\\) minutes with no customers. What is the probability Sadie has to wait at least another \\(15\\) minutes before one finally arrives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers arrive at a rate of \\(3\\) per hour, and thus, the time between any customers arriving will be distributed as an \\(\\text{Exp}(3)\\) random variable. As a result, Sadie should expect to wait \\(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\) hours (or \\(20\\) minutes) for the first customer.\nBecause all interarrival times are distributed the same way, the time between the \\(99\\)th and \\(100\\)th customer is distributed exactly as the time between the \\(0\\)th and \\(1\\)st, and as a result, the answer is the same as part (a).\nLet \\(T\\) be the time of arrival for the first customer. We want to know \\(P(T &gt; 1 | T &gt; \\dfrac{3}{4})\\) which we can solve for knowing that \\(T \\sim \\text{Exp}(3)\\) and as such the memoryless property applies. Thus, \\[P(T &gt; 1 | T &gt; \\dfrac{3}{4}) = P(T &gt; \\dfrac{1}{4}) = 1 - (1 - \\exp(-\\dfrac{3}{4})) = \\exp(-3/4) \\approx 0.4724.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.10.3 The Exponential Distribution in the Real-World\nThe exponential distribution arises frequently in the modelling of extreme events and in the lifetimes of objects. Most frequently, it arises as the interarrival time in Poisson processes. While it is often not a perfect representation of the underlying reality, it will frequently work well enough to provide useful results. The exponential distribution is itself a part of a large family of distributions know as the gamma distribution. We will consider the Gamma distribution next, however, owing to the compact form and the frequent use of the exponential distribution, it is worth considering separate from the remainder of the gamma family distributions.",

The probability density function for \\(X \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is given by \\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\beta^{\\alpha}}x^{\\alpha - 1}\\exp(-\\frac{x}{\\beta}).\\] In this expression, \\(\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\) is the Gamma function, a function which is expressible in general only via an integral.\n\nDefinition 9.13 (Gamma Function) The Gamma function, denoted \\(\\Gamma(k)\\), is a function given by \\[\\Gamma(k) = \\int_{0}^\\infty x^{k-1}e^{-x}dx.\\] If \\(k\\) is a positive integer, then \\(\\Gamma(k) = (k-1)!\\), and in general, \\(\\Gamma(k) = (k-1)\\Gamma(k - 1)\\).\n\nNote that if \\(X \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\alpha, \\beta)\\), then \\(E[X] = \\alpha\\beta\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\alpha\\beta^2\\).26 The cumulative distribution function can be expressed as \\[F(x) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\gamma(\\alpha, \\frac{x}{\\beta}),\\] where \\(\\gamma(a, b)\\) is the lower incomplete gamma function, given by \\[\\gamma(a, b) = \\int_{0}^b x^{a-1}e^{-x}dx.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: The Gamma distribution shown for various combinations of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.11.1 Connection to Other Distributions\nIt was briefly mentioned above that the exponential distribution is actually a special case of the Gamma distribution. If we investigate the corresponding desnity functions we may note that taking \\(\\alpha = 1\\) and \\(\\beta = \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda}\\) gives us \\[f(x) = \\lambda\\exp(-\\lambda x),\\] which is exactly the exponential probability density function. As a result we can say that \\(\\text{Exp}(\\lambda) = \\text{Gamma}(1, 1/\\lambda)\\). The Gamma distribution is connected to several important distributions that arise throughout the study of probability and statistics.\nBeyond the exponential, the most prominent distribution which is connecte to the Gamma is the chi-squared distribution. The chi-squared distribution is a distribution that arises in many statistical inference procedures. It is characterized by a single parameter, \\(\\nu\\), referred to as the degrees of freedom. To characterize the chi-squared distribution with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom, denoted \\(\\chi^2_\\nu\\), we take \\(X \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\nu/2, 2)\\). Thus, the mean of the distribution is \\(\\nu\\) and the variance is \\(2\\nu\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: The chi-sqaured distribution shown for increasing degrees of freedom.",

The relevant functions are, as in the discrete case, d{distname} and p{distname}, where {distname} is one the named distributions. These evaluate the density and cumulative distribution functions, respectively. So for instance, dnorm and pnorm calculate normal probabilities, dt and pt calculate probability for the \\(t\\) distribution, dexp and pexp calculate exponential probabilities, dgamma and pgamma calculate Gamma probabilities, and dchisq and pchisq calculate the chi-squared probabilities.\nEach function takes in a set of parameters to indicate which of the specific distributions is being considered.

We addressed these in terms of probability assignment using the language of singletons above. As a general rule, when working with continuous quantities, we simply ignore all of the singletons.↩︎\nIf you have taken calculus, you may recognize this process as feeling related to the first principle definition of a derivative. While it is often described in a slightly different way, this feeling of connection is intentional.↩︎\nThis is not a rare occurrence either. For instance, if we consider a random variable that will take on values in the interval \\([0,0.5]\\) with equal likelihood, the probability density function in this case will be \\(f(x) = 2\\).↩︎\nThink about the fact that, while we may think of human adult heights as a continuous quantity, it is far more likely to observe a height around \\(5\\) feet \\(6\\) inches than around \\(9\\) feet \\(2\\) inches.↩︎\nIn the continuous case we cannot sum over the sample space, and so we must use techniques from calculus to mirror this process, for instance.↩︎\nAs a note, the integrate to one and sum to one properties for density functions and mass functions, respectively, are an additional example of a situation wherein the sum and integral can be interchanged for one another.↩︎\nWhen \\(F\\) is not strictly invertible, we can instead consider the generalized inverse based on the right-continuity of \\(F\\), giving \\(F^{-1}(p) = \\inf\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mid p \\leq F(x)\\}\\).↩︎\nWhich we have actually already seen.↩︎\nWhich is far and away the most important distribution (discrete or continuous) in all of probability and statistics.↩︎\nThe exponential is actually a special case of the gamma distribution, as are several other important named distributions, which will be brought up as required.↩︎\nSometimes called the continuous uniform distribution to distinguish it from its discrete counterpart.↩︎\nIn Example 9.1 we implicitly used the cumulative distribution function of the uniform. It is worth revisiting these probabilities knowing that this is the case.↩︎\nFor instance, in Example 8.6, we implicitly used a continuous uniform distribution to give the probability that Charles hits the dartboard.

    "text": "10.1 From Probability to Statistics\nUntil this point we have focused on the study of probability. At its core, probability is a subject which seeks to quantify the uncertainty present in statistical experiments. In the study of probability we begin by first making assumptions about the state of the world1 and from there we draw conclusions about what must be true about the state of uncertainty in the world. In this regard, probability answers questions of the form “if this is true about the world, what should we see?” For instance, if a fair coin is tossed \\(100\\) times, what is the likelihood that more than half of the tosses come up heads? We have made the assumption that we have a fair coin, tossed independently, and we wish to quantify our degree of uncertainty about this scenario.\nWgat tge fuck&gt;\nThis is not the only way that we could frame problems related to uncertainty. For instance, what if we asked “given the results from \\(100\\) tosses of this coin, do we believe that the coin is fair?” This inversion of the previous question starts from the observation of information from an experiment and asks questions about the underlying mechanisms that generated these data.2 This type of question is addressed by the field of statistics.\nIn Probability we make assumptions about the world and calculate probabilities. These probabilities describe what we should expect to see if we were to observe the processes as they were assumed to exist. In Statistics, we collect information from statistical experiments, and use these data to infer what conditions were likely to have given rise to our observations. We are back solving for what set of assumptions is most plausible, given the observations. Uncertainty remains at the core of statistics. We will rarely be able to know for certain what different assumptions gave rise to the data that we observe, but instead look to clarify and quantify the ever-present uncertainty. Probability remains central to the study of statistics. Specifically, probability is the core tool for quantifying the ever-present uncertainty. Probability statements are the language of Statistics. As a result, the study of Statistics is largely the study of how we can take the set of tools that have been developed throughout the first part of these notes, and apply them in the reverse direction. Statistics gives us the tools that we need to make sense of the world around us. Statistics serves as a process for evaluating the quality of evidence and drawing conclusions from it. Statistics is the necessary area of study to draw informed conclusions from the information that we collect. Ultimately, it is Statistics which powers quantitative decision-making. Virtually every avenue of the modern world demands that we make decisions on the basis of incomplete or imperfect information, and through Statistics we can ensure that these decisions are as informed as possible.",

    "section": "10.2 Background and Data",
    "text": "10.2 Background and Data\nIt is important to formalize some of the terminology upon which we will rely. A key challenge in formalizing these ideas is that, for many of these central concepts, we have an intuitive or colloquial sense of the idea. Just as with Probability, a large part of our goal during the early phases of learning Statistics revolves around connecting formalized ideas to intuitive concepts that we are familiar with from other contexts.\n\nDefinition 10.2 (Data) Facts, figures, observations, or recordings in virtually any form (images, sounds, text, measurements) which are gathered and processed to form and communicate conclusions.\n\nData sit at the center of Statistics as the prime objects of study. We are concerned with how we can take data and draw valid conclusions. This may be by ensuring that the data are collected in a way which is suitable to draw conclusions, or by finding ways to graphically display the information within collected data, or by drawing inferences about the world using the data on hand. Data are the prime focus of Statistics. The data themselves are not particularly descriptive or actionable. Instead, the data are transformed into useful information through statistical techniques. We will broadly refer to any such process as a statistical analysis.\nThe goal of a statistical analysis can be placed into one of four categories. These categories define the four purposes of statistics.\n\nDescriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics focuses on organizing and summarizing information. With descriptive statistics we seek to describe the current state of the world which lead to the data we have collected.\nInferential statistics: Inferential statistics provides methods for drawing conclusions and quantifying the uncertainty surrounding these conclusions, with regards to a population or process response for the data collected. With inferential statistics we seek to infer the underlying truth about a population or process of interest.\nPredictive statistics: Predictive statistics provides methods for making predictions regarding the future behaviour of a process or population based on past observations from that population or process. With predictive statistics we seek to predict what is to come in the future.\nPrescriptive statistics: Prescriptive statistics provides methods for suggesting interventions into a population or process according to its likely impact on a chosen criterion. With prescriptive statistics we seek to prescribe interventions based on what is likely to happen.\n\n\nExample 10.1 (Charles and Sadie Categorized Questions) Back out for coffee after a relaxing break, Charles and Sadie turn their attention to thinking about the possible use cases for Statistics. They begin to play a game, trying to identify which of the four major categories would be most appropriate to address their various questions of interest. For each of the following, identify whether the problem is best approached through descriptive, inferential, predictive, or prescriptive statistical techniques.\n\nCharles wonders how many people, on average, visit the coffee shop each day.\nSadie wonders if the type of music playing in the shop impacts what purchases customers make.\nCharles wants to determine how many chocolate chip cookies the coffee shop should prepare for Saturday morning.\nSadie wonders what the most common drink add-in is.\nCharles wants to know how much the coffee shop should sell their coffees for, if they are trying to maximize income.\nSadie wants to understand how many people have signed up for the loyalty program.\nCharles wonders if there is a meaningful difference between people’s orders who sign up for the loyalty program and those who don’t.\nSadie, in turn, questions how much the loyalty program is likely to grow over the next month.\nCharles wants to understand how the reward tiers can be changed to grow the royalty program faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is descriptive. This is an attempt to describe the state of the world as it exists.\nThis is inferential. This is an attempt to draw conclusions regarding the true state of the world.\nThis is predictive. This is an attempt to understand the future behaviour of uncertain quantities.\nThis is descriptive. This is an attempt to describe the state of the world as it exists.\nThis is prescriptive. This is an attempt to suggest an intervention to achieve a desired outcome.\nThis is descriptive. This is an attempt to describe the state of the world as it exists.\nThis is inferential. This is an attempt to draw conclusions regarding the true state of the world.\nThis is predictive. This is an attempt to understand the future behaviour of uncertain quantities.\nThis is prescriptive. This is an attempt to suggest an intervention to achieve a desired outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the various roles that statistics can play is defined in terms of populations3. We understand this at an intuitive level, and this intuition is strong place to begin to formalize Statistics.\n\nDefinition 10.3 (Population) The collection of all individuals or items that are under consideration in a study or experiment.\n\nIn many settings, the population is a well-defined, concrete idea. We may think of all individuals who attend a particular university, all birds of a species living in a particular park, all cars of a particular model made last year at a given factory. In each of these cases we can envision taking all members of the population4 and placing them in one location. If we were able to do this, any questions we had about the population could be directly answered. This is not typically possible in these cases owing to practical considerations regarding the resources that would be required.5 In many other settings, we cannot even imagine grouping the entire population of interest together, since the population is less concretely defined.\nConsider, for instance, investigating the quality of vaccines that are produced at a particular facility. This facility will continue producing vaccines indefinitely into the future, and we may wish to know about the set of these future items. Similarly, we may wish to understand the impact of a particular teaching style on children’s ability to learn math skills. In this case, we are not concerned with one particular school or one particular school board or one particular set of students. Rather we want to know how children in general respond to this teaching intervention. In cases like these the population of interest is less concrete and more conceptual. It is not a specific well-defined group of individuals or items, and it may be possibly infinite. Instead of being able to collect all of the items of the population together we are only able to assess any individual or item and answer “is this a member of the described population?”. We refer to these as conceptual populations.\n\nDefinition 10.4 (Conceptual Population) A set of individuals, items, or observations which are hypothetical in the sense that they do not tangibly exist as a concrete group, but instead share a common feature which defines the population. The units in the conceptual population are linked through the circumstances that they arise under resulting from conditions which are equivalent in some way. Sometimes conceptual populations are called hypothetical populations.\n\nThe utility of a conceptual population is that it allows us to unify the framework of Statistics whether we are studying groups of people or objects that really do exist in front of us, or those which we can describe but not collect. Even something as well-defined as the population of a country, for instance, is a population which may be conceptual in many regards. There are constantly new individuals being born in the country, those who are dying, those moving to or away from it. Still, none of us are confused about what we mean by the “population of a country”. Likewise, conceptual populations in statistics are well-defined, even if they remain intangible.\n\nExample 10.2 (Charles and Sadie Identify Populations) Charles and Sadie had such fun identifying the uses for statistics during their last conversation, today at coffee they decide to identify populations of interest. They open up the local paper to the science section, and begin to read the headlines. For each headline, indicate the population of interest and specify whether or not this is a conceptual population.\n\n“Study Finds Link Between Coffee Consumption and Productivity in Office Workers”\n“Research Shows Decline in Pollinator Populations Across Agricultural Regions”\n“Poll Indicates Attitudes Toward Healthcare Reform Among Registered Voters”\n“Research Reveals Impact of Air Pollution on Respiratory Health Among Children in New York City in 2023”\n“Survey Explores Relationship Between Social Support and Mental Health Among LGBTQ+ Youth”\n“Poll Indicates Satisfaction with Public Transportation Among Commuters in Metropolitan Areas in Canada”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population of interest here is simply “office workers”. This is a conceptual population as we can easily tell whether or not someone belongs to the population (ask whether they work in an office), but we cannot easily describe the complete group of individuals.\nThe population of interest here is pollinators in agricultural regions. This is a conceptual population as it will be constantly shifting and changing. We are able to describe whether a particular animal is a pollinator living in an agricultural region, but we are not able to enumerate through the animals which would satisfy this.\nThe population of interest here is registered voters (wherever the study is run). This is not a conceptual population as a voter registry contains a list of all of the people within this population. It may be the case that this will change over time, but we can concretely determine the population at this point in time.\nThe population is children in New York City in 2023. This is not a conceptual population as, while there is not any practical way of gathering all children living in New York City in 2023 together in one place, this is a fully describable population that (given enough resources) could be gathered together.\nThe population of interest here is LGBTQ+ youth. This is a conceptual population, as we are able to assess membership to the population, but not fully enumerate the members.\nThe population here is Canadian metropolitan-area commuters. This is a conceptual population.\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, our goal with statistics is to understand a population. However, as a general rule, we are unable to directly observe the entirety of the population. While it is typically infeasible to observe the entire population, we are often able to observe some units from the population. These units, when collected together, are referred to as a sample.\n\nDefinition 10.5 (Sample) A sample is a subset of a population which is observed, and as a result, information regarding these units is obtainable.\n\nThus, taken together we are interested in a particular population. We are typically unable to observe our population in full, and instead content ourselves with the capacity to view a subset of this population, which is referred to as a sample. Generally speaking, we are interested in some numeric quantities which describe the population. Perhaps we wish to know the average height of students in a school, or the total number of calls that are made at a company over a period of time, or the maximum litter size for a breed of house cats, or the proportion of defective units produced during a manufacturing run. In each of these situations, the question of interest relates to a quantity describing the population. If we were able to view the entirety of the population, we could simply compute the value of quantity. We refer to such quantities as parameters.\n\nDefinition 10.6 (Parameter) A parameter is a numeric quantity of interest which is defined with regards to a population. A parameter captures the behaviour of the population. Typically the value of parameters will be unknown and unknowable.\n\nThe fact that parameters are generally unknowable is the central tension at the heart of many statistical problems. To resolve this tension we turn our focus towards quantities which can be computed, namely those which are derived from samples that we have taken. These quantities are aptly named statistics.\n\nDefinition 10.7 (Statistics (Quantities)) A statistic is a numeric quantity of interest that is computed on a sample. Any quantity which is calculated based on observed data from a sample is a statistic.\n\nIn this regard, Statistics as a subject is the study of statistics (as quantities). For instance, if we take the average height of a group of students, or the number of calls made by a selection of employees during a period of time, or the maximum size that a particular cat breeder has for a litter, or the proportion of defective products from a random selection of items sampled from a manufacturing run, each of these are statistics. Note that to differentiate a statistic from a parameter we are functionally differentiating between whether the quantity was computed on a sample or a population. There is no difference in the quantity itself, it is what the quantity is computed with respect to.\nThus, with these definitions we are able to concretely outline the process of statistics. We have interest in a particular population, conceptual or otherwise. Specifically, we have questions which are answered by parameters defined for this population. These parameters are unknowable since it is infeasible to observe all members of the population, and so instead we turn to taking observations for subsets of the population. These subsets are called samples, and samples are observable. Once observed, we are able to compute quantities of interest on the samples, referred to as statistics. It is our hope that somehow these statistics will be representative of the underlying parameters of interest, thus allowing us to answer the questions about the populations using information from the sample.\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: On overview of the process of statistics. Visualized is the complete population, which is unable to be observed in full. There exist a parameter (or parameters) of interest that are computable from this population. We take a sample (subset) of this population, and can more accurately observe this sample, allowing us to compute the value of a statistic. This statistic is meant to correspond to the parameter of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.3 (Experiments in the Coffee Shop) Charles and Sadie, fully bought into the process of statistics, decide to put their new knowledge to the test. To do so they wish to determine how the process of statistics would apply to the world around them, in the coffee shop. For each of the following scenarios indicate what the population of interest would be, whether it is conceptual or concrete, identify the parameter of interest, a possible sample of size \\(4\\), and the relevant statistic.\n\nTo understand the daily traffic in the coffee shop, Charles counts the number of individuals who pass into the store in a particular hour.\nTo better understand the profitability of the store, Sadie collects the receipt totals for each of the customers arriving at the coffee shop.\nTo understand how the coffee shop has integrated into the community, both Charles and Sadie monitor the proportion of customers who are students at the local school, each day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population of interest is the customers of the coffee shop. This is a conceptual population. The parameter of interest is the average number of customers per day arriving at the coffee shop. Notably, Charles is measuring the average number per hour rather than per day, but this could be accommodated for during the analysis. Samples of size \\(4\\) would observe watching four separate hours, and counting the number of customers in the store each hour: one possibility would be \\(\\{5, 35, 3, 22\\}\\). The statistic calculated is likely the average per hour (or a scaled version to convert it to the day). Based on the sample that is \\(16.25\\).\nThe population of interest is the purchases made at the coffee shop. This is a conceptual population. The parameter of interest is the average size of a purchase. Samples of size \\(4\\) would include any four observations of totals that could be observed at the store, perhaps \\(\\{\\$1.20, \\$23.18, \\$14.21, \\$5.87\\}\\). The statistic of interest would be the average size of the transaction. Based on the sample that is \\(\\$11.115\\).\nHere, the population of interest is the customers of the coffee shop. This is a conceptual population. The parameter of interest is the proportion of customers who are students at the local school. A sample of size \\(4\\) would be any four proportions observed from the day, perhaps \\(\\{0.2, 0.1, 0.08, 0.25\\}\\). The statistic of interest is the average proportion, based on the sample that is \\(0.1825\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this process outlined, we can revisit the roles that statistics will serve. Ultimately, our goal is to effectively use collected data6 to discern and communicate information. We look to do this by:\n\ndescribing the collected data, conveying the information that we have gathered;\ninferring conclusions about our population parameters from our sample statistics;\npredicting out-of-sample observations, based on the sampled ones; or\nprescribing interventions for the population to influence a parameter.\n\nThe value in each of these applications stems from the capacity that we have to connect the sample to the population. As a result, much of our statistical focus centers on finding ways to ensure that our conclusions drawn from our sample are reflective of the overall population.\nTo understand how this is possible, consider an experiment which seeks to determine whether a particular coin is fair. Suppose that we toss it \\(100\\) times, and see \\(54\\) heads. Is this a fair coin? While we cannot be entirely sure, this seems to be more-or-less in line with the number of heads that we would expect to see if the coin were fair. There is uncertainty present, but we can be more certain that this is a fair coin compared to our beliefs prior to running the experiment. Now imagine that instead of seeing \\(54\\) heads on \\(100\\) tosses, we had seen \\(94\\). Immediately we should be skeptical that this coin is fair. It is perfectly possible that we see \\(94\\) heads on \\(100\\) tosses of a fair coin7, but it is not likely. It does not seem to be what we would expect to observe, and as a result, we are right to be skeptical of this.\nThis intuitive connection between what we can say about the population and the sample relies upon the sample being representative of the population. We would not take flips from another coin to be evidence of whether our coin is biased. We would not consider the sample to be particularly representative if instead of writing down every result, we ignored every time that more than one tail came up in a row. The intuitions we have about the relationship between our sample and our population rely on the assumption that the sample represents the population in some meaningful sense. Choosing a representative sample is, as a result, an important aspect of the statistical process.",

    "section": "10.3 Sampling",
    "text": "10.3 Sampling\nSampling is an area of study within statistics which focuses on the process through which units are recruited from the population into our sample. If the units we observe are biased in some way, or are inappropriately recruited, then it is immediately clear that conclusions drawn about the sample will not be transportable to the population. Imagine, for instance, that we are interested in the height of students at a university. If our sample contains only members of the basketball and volleyball teams, this will not be reflective of the heights of most students at the school. Our sample is unrepresentative. With sampling our goal is to select the sample in such a way so as to make guarantees about the information we learn from it, quantifying our uncertainty, and being relatively confident in our conclusions.\nWhen we deal with populations which are conceptual in nature it may make less sense to think of sampling directly. For instance, it seems strange to think of our previous example of repeatedly rolling a die in the same manner that we think of recruiting students and measuring their heights. In the case where we wish to learn about a process rather than a concrete population, we will often frame the generation of our sample not through the language of sampling but rather through the language of experimental design. The design of experiments refers to the same set of factors that are considered for sampling: how can we ensure that the units we observe will be representative of the underlying population or process. However, with experimental design it is largely the case that we are in direct control of the types of factors that may lead our process to being unrepresentative. It is up to us to ensure that the units that are being generated, through the conceptual population, are representative of the units we are interested in based on the research question.\nOur focus in this class will be on investigating several of the techniques used in sampling and experimental design to ensure that the samples we use are related to the population of interest in predictable ways. It will always be possible that, even following best practices and being very careful with our implementation, we end up choosing a sample or having experimental units which are nonrepresentative. This is uncertainty which is unavoidable in any scientific inquiry. Our goal then is to understand this uncertainty, to quantify it, and to ensure that we are able to understand precisely how big of a risk is this lack of representation, and how that will change the results we can report. We begin by describing techniques which can be used to ensure that samples are good representations for the populations of interest. In the next section, we will turn to the same types of considerations for experimental design.\n\n10.3.1 Simple Random Sampling\nWhen considering the process of data collection via sampling, the primary decision to make is on the sampling design. The sampling design refers to the strategy that is employed to decide which members of the population will comprise the sample. Some sampling designs will not result in valid or representative samples. The most straightforward sampling design, which, if applied correctly, will produce valid samples is simple random sampling.\n\nDefinition 10.8 (Simple Random Sampling) Simple random sampling is a sampling procedure in which each possible sample of a given size is equally likely to be obtained.\n\nSimple random sampling produces a simple random sample. Simple random sampling is far and away the most important sampling scheme. It is an effective way of drawing a representative sample itself, it is intuitive, and it forms the basis of many other, more complex sampling schemes. Generally, we can think of simple random sampling as sampling without replacement.8 Suppose we take our population to correspond to items in an urn, each labelled with the corresponding unit. Then a simple random sample is typically formed by selecting \\(n\\) items from the urn without replacement. Those which are selected form the sample. If desired, for any reason at all, it is possible to form a simple random sample with replacement, where in this setting the balls would be placed back into the urn after each selection. Whether the sample is to be formed with or without replacement, the same general procedure will be followed. Each member of the population will get assigned a numeric label (from \\(1\\) through to \\(N\\), the population size) and then software is used to select a subset of \\(n\\) of the labels.\n\nExample 10.4 (Rating Coffee Orders) Charles and Sadie are still attending the coffee shop, and Charles is still working through the \\(960\\) different orders that are available (recall Example 3.5). Sadie, with a stronger grasp on statistics now, decides to try to understand the general quality of orders at the coffee shop. To do so, instead of ordering every possible meal (as Charles is doing), Sadie considers a simple random sample of possible orders.\n\nSuppose that Sadie wants to understand the quality based on the next twenty visits to the coffee shop. Describe the procedure for forming a simple random sample.\nWhat is the probability that Sadie’s current order will be one of the orders included in the simple random sample?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSadie desires a simple random sample of size \\(n=20\\) from the \\(N=960\\) different orders. To do so, suppose that we order each of the orders from \\(1,2,\\dots,960\\) (perhaps ordered based on the order in which Charles will try them). Then Sadie will randomly select, without replacement, \\(20\\) numbers from these values. These orders will then be taken over the next twenty visits, with Sadie recording whatever information is relevant for each of them. For instance, Sadie may end up select the orders corresponding to:\n\n\n##  [1] 834 499 529 376 910 931 549 620 623 169 419 754 296  80 276 342 918 855 265\n## [20]  87\n\n\nSadie’s current order is \\(1\\) of the possible options of the \\(960\\). While we can work this out from first principles, we can also take this to be a hypergeometric random variable with \\(n=20\\), \\(N=960\\), and \\(M=1\\). Then we want \\(P(X = 1)\\). For this, using the probability mass function of a hypergeometric random variable, we get \\[P(X = 1) = \\frac{\\binom{1}{1}\\binom{959}{19}}{\\binom{960}{20}} = \\frac{1}{48}.\\] Note this is \\(\\dfrac{20}{960} = \\dfrac{n}{N}\\). In general, this will be true for any simple random sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an appeal in the simplicity of simple random sampling. Moreover, it is quite clear how, as long as enough units are sampled, simple random sampling will result in a sample which is representative of the overall population. Despite these benefits, there are some drawbacks that are not easily overcome in the simple random sampling paradigm. For instance, if you imagine a situation in which your sample is spread over a large geographic region, it is unlikely to be practical to form a simple random sample. Additionally, if you do not have a list of all population members, a simple random sample cannot be formed as described.9 Another practical concern involves sampling in this regard when units have a natural ordering. Suppose that you are looking to test the impact of a new cancer therapy, and wish to form a sample of current cancer patients who will receive the experimental treatment to see if it improves over the current practice. If you form through simple random sampling it is possible that you will have only patients who are newly diagnosed or else only patients who have had their diagnosis for a long time. Neither situation is a particularly effective method for testing the therapy, and it becomes a large practice issue where you likely want to ensure that you have both sets of individuals represented in the sample.\nTo overcome these issues with simple random sampling, alternative sampling designs have been proposed. These alternatives can lead to more convenience in the sampling, and perhaps yield more accurate results than a simple random sample can. It is important to note that these alternative designs are only more effective when the design itself is taken into account when analyzing or describing the data.\n\n\n10.3.2 Systematic Random Sampling\nOne alternative design to simple random sampling, which is closely related, is known as systematic random sampling.\n\nDefinition 10.9 (Systematic Random Sampling) In systematic random sampling the sample is selected by choosing a random starting point from the list of members of the population, and then sampling every \\(k\\)th member until the desired sample size is reached.\n\nSystematic sampling forms a sample that looks like a simple random sample, but it is more straightforward to implement. If you want a sample of size \\(50\\) from a population of size \\(500\\), then by selecting every \\(10\\)th member of the population, you will achieve the sample you desire. You want to be able to pick any individual from the population, and so you should randomly select the starting point before picking every \\(10\\)th member. Selecting every \\(10th\\) individual is more straightforward administratively than generating random numbers and sampling those indices, particularly when there is a natural ordering of the individuals. However, there are some implementation decisions which need to be made, notably: what should \\(k\\) be and who should be the first individual included? It is common to have the process of systematic random sampling described as follows.\n\nDivide the population size, \\(N\\), by the desired sample size, \\(n\\), and round the result down to the nearest whole number. This will be \\(k\\).\nSelect a number, \\(m\\), randomly between \\(1\\) and \\(k\\). This will be the starting point.\nInclude in the sample \\(m\\), \\(m+k\\), \\(m+2k\\), and so forth until the last unit of the sample.\n\nThis will generally form a usable sample, if its shortcomings are properly accounted for. However, it is not without its shortcomings as a procedure.\nTo understand why this can lead to issues suppose that we have \\(N=7\\), and want to form a sample of size \\(n=3\\). Using this procedure we get \\(k=2\\), as the result of rounding down \\(\\dfrac{7}{3}=2.33\\dot3\\). Next, we select either \\(1\\) or \\(2\\) as our starting point. If we select \\(1\\) then we end up including \\(\\{1,3,5\\}\\) and if we select \\(2\\) then we get \\(\\{2,4,6\\}\\). Note that in we will never select item number \\(7\\), which means that there is no chance it is represented in our sample. This is a problem. There are plenty of ways to resolve this concern, some of which lead to other issues themselves.\nOne small modification that can be made is to select \\(m\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(N-(n-1)k\\).10 This will ensure that it is always possible to select up to the last unit. In our example with \\(N=7\\) and \\(n=3\\), the starting point is selected from \\(1,2,3\\) giving in addition to the two possibilities outlined above, \\(\\{3,5,7\\}\\) as a third option. This alleviates the issues of not including some members of the population in any possible sample. When this technique is used, however, it is worth noting that some elements become more likely to be included than the others.11 This can be accounted for during analysis, but it needs to be completely understood to do so.\n\nExample 10.5 (Randomly Sampling Customer Experience) Sadie, content with the results of the simple random sampling of possible meals, decides to try to understand the overall customer satisfaction of individuals coming into the coffee shop. Charles suggests that a systematic sample may be in order, and they set out planning this.\nSuppose that Charles and Sadie expect there to be \\(98\\) customers arriving in a day, and they wish to sample \\(10\\) of them.\n\nDescribe the process of forming a systematic sample from this population, including the specific values for the choices that are made.\nWhat is a risk of this sampling design?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we have \\(N=98\\) and want \\(n=10\\), thus we take \\(k = \\lfloor\\dfrac{98}{10}\\rfloor = 9\\). We want to select the starting value between \\(1\\) and \\(98 - 9\\times(10-1) = 98 - 81 = 17\\). Thus there are a total of \\(17\\) different samples we could wind up with. These are summarized as follows:\n\n\n##       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]\n##  [1,]    1   10   19   28   37   46   55   64   73    82\n##  [2,]    2   11   20   29   38   47   56   65   74    83\n##  [3,]    3   12   21   30   39   48   57   66   75    84\n##  [4,]    4   13   22   31   40   49   58   67   76    85\n##  [5,]    5   14   23   32   41   50   59   68   77    86\n##  [6,]    6   15   24   33   42   51   60   69   78    87\n##  [7,]    7   16   25   34   43   52   61   70   79    88\n##  [8,]    8   17   26   35   44   53   62   71   80    89\n##  [9,]    9   18   27   36   45   54   63   72   81    90\n## [10,]   10   19   28   37   46   55   64   73   82    91\n## [11,]   11   20   29   38   47   56   65   74   83    92\n## [12,]   12   21   30   39   48   57   66   75   84    93\n## [13,]   13   22   31   40   49   58   67   76   85    94\n## [14,]   14   23   32   41   50   59   68   77   86    95\n## [15,]   15   24   33   42   51   60   69   78   87    96\n## [16,]   16   25   34   43   52   61   70   79   88    97\n## [17,]   17   26   35   44   53   62   71   80   89    98\n\n\nThis sampling design has several risks. The first is that there is no guarantee that \\(N=98\\) is the correct population size. As a result, this could end up not producing \\(n=10\\) or having \\(n=10\\) before the end of the day. A second possible issue is if there are temporal patterns to customers arriving, such that groups of customers are missed with high probability. Cyclical patterns do not lend themselves well to systematic sampling, and it is plausible that customer arrivals to a coffee shop may exhibit some cyclical tendencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Cluster Sampling\nWhile systematic sampling can be a more straightforward method for implementing a sample that looks like a simple random sample, it is generally not going to alleviate concerns with (for instance) geographic separation. In this case the issue with either of the two aforementioned sampling schemes is that they each would take substantial resources to send researchers to the area where the units to be sampled are. A remedy to this is to turn to cluster sampling.\n\nDefinition 10.10 (Cluster Sampling) In cluster sampling individuals are grouped together into clusters. The clusters are then sampled at random, according to a simple random sampling scheme. Any selected cluster is then sampled in full.\n\nFor instance, you may define clusters based on the geographic region that is occupied. This way you can ensure, for instance, that you only visit a set number of geographic regions, while still sampling enough individuals to collect useful data. A key criterion for cluster sampling to be valid is that each cluster should represent the overall population well. This can be an issue where members of a cluster are often more similar to one another than to members of other clusters. As a result, you can end up with an unrepresentative sample owing to the clustered nature of the sampling. In order to form a cluster sample, the procedure is essentially equivalent to simple random sampling. First, the population is divided into groups (clusters) which are labelled from \\(1\\) through to the number of clusters that there are. Then, the clusters are randomly sampled, according to a simple random sample. Finally, all members of the selected clusters are included into the overall sample.\n\nExample 10.6 (Charles and Sadie Sample their City) Charles and Sadie are reflecting upon the chocolate bars that they sold for charity in the past. They want to understand the feelings that members of their city have towards charitable giving. They feel that sampling \\(300\\) homes is a useful number, but given that they will be going door-to-door, they want to do this in a clustered pattern. The city is made up of \\(947\\) blocks, each with \\(20\\) homes on it.\n\nDescribe how Charles and Sadie could use clustered sampling to form the sample that they desire.\nWhat issues may arise using clustered sampling in this way?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we have \\(N=18940\\) and we want a sample of \\(n=300\\). In order to achieve \\(n=300\\), we require selecting \\(15\\) clusters, since each cluster has \\(20\\) homes in it. Thus, Charles and Sadie should label the blocks \\(1\\) through \\(947\\), and then select \\(15\\) of these at random. Once the \\(15\\) blocks are selected, all \\(20\\) homes on each should be visited. One possible sample would be\n\n\n##  [1] 834 499 529 376 910 931 549 620 623 169 419 754 296  80 276\n\n\nA major issue with this type of clustering is that homes that are on the same block are likely to be fairly homogenous. That is, city blocks will often be divided by socioeconomic status, education, and other demographic factors. As a result, selecting a full cluster is not likely to give a representative cross-section of the complete city, and instead, is likely to be skewed based on which clusters happen to be included. It seems very likely that with a survey investigating thoughts towards charitable giving, socioeconomic factors will play a role.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe major concern with cluster sampling is that, if the clusters are grouped together based on relevant information, the sample becomes predictably unrepresentative of the overall population. Because the clusters are often naturally formed based on a relevant factor (like geographic location), if this factor influences the topic that is being studied, the clustering design will influence the validity of the results. Still, cluster sampling, when done correctly, alleviates many of the difficulties with practically implementing a simple random sample.\n\nRemark (Systematic Sampling as Cluster Sampling). Mathematically, systematic sampling can be seen as a particular form of cluster sampling. To see this note that, once \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are defined, the set of individuals who are included in any given sample are completely defined and grouped together. As a result, you could preform these groupings of individuals, and treat those as clusters together. Then, instead of sampling individuals, you are sampling a cluster of individuals.\nThe key difference between cluster sampling and systematic sampling is that the clusters in systematic sampling are not typically naturally defined. There is not normally going to be a clear separation forming the groups in this way, and as a result, it may not be easier to run a geographically isolated systematic sample than it is to run a geographically isolated simple random sample. However, the understanding of equivalence mathematically is useful when data from these samples are to be analyzed as the tools from cluster random sampling can be put to use to validly analyze systematic data.\n\n\n\n10.3.4 Stratified Random Sampling\nThe key issue with cluster sampling is that natural clusters of individuals typically exhibit self-similarity. This is an issue when your sample is formed via complete clusters, however, it can be turned into a benefit to ensure a greater reliability of the sample itself. Exploiting this self-similarity leads to a sampling technique known as stratified sampling.\n\nDefinition 10.11 (Stratified Sampling) In stratified sampling the population is divided into sub-populations known as strata. These strata should be comprised of groups of similar individuals. A simple random sample is formed within each strata, and each of the simple random samples are combined together to form the overall sample.\n\nThe major benefits of stratified sampling are two-fold. First, you will typically have more precision in your conclusions being drawn than from other sampling schemes. The reason being that individuals within a strata will be similar to one another, and so the variability that will arise based on which individuals are included is smaller than in other sampling schemes. Second, you are able to split your data into the different sub-populations describing results and conclusions for each group of individuals. This allows us to make conclusions both at the population level as a whole, but also at the sub-population level, which is often of direct interest.\nTo implement stratified sampling, you need to decide how many individuals will be sampled within each strata. A simple but effective way of doing this is to use proportional allocation. With proportional allocation the strata that are larger will have more members sampled than the strata which are smaller, which is a natural decision to make. To implement stratified random sampling with proportional allocation: 1. Divide the population into strata, based on a relevant and natural dividing criteria. 2. Within each strata, conduct a simple random sample of size \\(n_j\\), where \\(n_j\\) is given by \\(n\\times\\frac{N_j}{N}\\), where \\(n\\) is the desired sample size, \\(N_j\\) is the size of the \\(j\\)th strata, and \\(N\\) is the size of the population as a whole. This should be rounded to the nearest whole number. 3. Form the sample by including all members from each of the sampled strata.\n\nExample 10.7 (Charles and Sadie Push for Transportation Infrastructure) Charles and Sadie have faced some push-back on their attempts to increase access to well-funded public transportation options within their city. To understand better where the resistance is coming from, they decide to conduct a survey of households in the town. There are \\(18940\\) total homes in the city, and Charles and Sadie figure that perhaps household income levels will influence opinions on investments in public infrastructure. Charles and Sadie categorize \\(940\\) of these households as high income, \\(10000\\) as middle income, and the remaining \\(8000\\) as low income. Suppose that they want a sample of size approximately \\(75\\) from this population.\n\nDescribe how a stratified sample can be formed in this setting.\nWhat potential drawbacks are there with using stratified sampling here?\nWhat other factors may have been useful to segment the population into natural strata?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis population is made up of three strata, with \\(N_1 = 940\\), \\(N_2 = 10000\\), and \\(N_3 = 8000\\). Using proportional allocation this will result in a sample from the first of size \\(n_1 = \\dfrac{940}{18940}\\times 75 = 3.7 \\approx 4\\). For the second we get \\(n_2 = \\dfrac{10000}{18940}\\times 75 = 39.6 \\approx 40\\). For the third we get \\(n_3 = \\dfrac{8000}{18940}\\times 75 = 31.6 \\approx 32\\). Taken together this gives \\(76\\) as the sample size, which is close to desired. Then, three separate simple random samples are to be formed. The first is a sample of \\(4\\) homes randomly selected from the numbers, \\(\\{1,\\dots,940\\}\\), the second is \\(40\\) homes randomly selected from \\(\\{1,\\dots,10000\\}\\) middle income homes, and the remaining \\(32\\) are selected from \\(\\{1,\\dots,8000\\}\\) from the low income households. These three groups are combined together, and interviewed to form the overall sample.\nThe major drawback is that this is likely to result in a costly sampling scheme. Specifically, as contrasted with the cluster sampling in Example 10.6, there is no guarantee that Charles and Sadie would not be required to travel across many of the blocks in their city. It is possible that to visit the \\(76\\) households, they have to visit \\(76\\) different blocks, which greatly increases the cost of administering the sample as described.\nIt may have also been useful to stratify the population, for instance, based on vehicle ownership, based on commuter status, or based on political leanings. Each of these is likely to be relevant to subgroup analyses, while also reducing the variability within the strata themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile stratified samples are often the most efficient samples, statistically, they do not alleviate many of the practical concerns regarding simple random samples. In fact, in some cases, these issues may even be exacerbated. If, for instance, strata are formed on the basis of geographic location, then forming a stratified sample will guarantee that it is required to visit each geographic location. The sampling scheme which is selected should be concordant with the goals of the analysis as well as the restrictions and constraints that are at play.\n\n\n10.3.5 Multistage Sampling\nSometimes the nature of the population, question of interest, or constraints at play render any single sampling design ineffective to construct a useful sample. In these cases multistage sampling can be an effective way of tailoring the sampling design to the specific requirements.\n\nDefinition 10.12 (Multistage Sampling) In multistage sampling one or more of the discussed sampling techniques are combined into a multistage procedure to effectively and efficiently target the population of interest. Multistage sampling may combine simple random sampling, systematic random sampling, cluster sampling, or stratified sampling in different sequences and orders to achieve a custom-specified sampling scheme.\n\nFor example, household surveys are commonly run. To do so, a researcher may randomly sample cities in the area of interest. Within those cities, they may stratify based on region in the city, and within each region cluster based on the blocks. Then, a simple random sample within the blocks is taken, and those households are selected. This sampling scheme can be understood in relation to each of the component sampling schemes, and creates a flexible way of constructing a sampling scheme which meets the needs of the situation.",

    "text": "10.4 Experimental Design\nWhile sampling is often a useful framing for collecting data, there are times where our goal is not to simply understand the way that a population is, but rather to understand the impact of particular intervention. Consider, for instance, studies which look at the efficacy of medical treatments, the utility of new fertilizers on agricultural yield, or the impact of political interventions on climate change. In each of these cases we are not interested in the current state of a population, but rather how some action influences the state of a population. For this, we turn to the process of experiment design. In experimental design we seek to understand how experimental units have their response variables impacted, based on the levels of particular factors, or treatments. In plain language our goal is to understand how specific interventions influence some trait in a population. To proceed we formally define each of these concepts.\n\nDefinition 10.13 (Experimental units) Individuals or items upon which the experiment is being performed. If the experimental units are humans, we will often call them subjects or patients, in place of units.\n\n\nDefinition 10.14 (Response Variable) The characteristic or trait of the experimental unit that is measured or observed. The experiment’s purpose is to understand how a response variable reacts to a particular intervention.\n\n\nDefinition 10.15 (Factor) A variable whose effect on the response variable is of interest. The factor is the variable which is being controlled or manipulated within the experiment, and is the cause of the change in response variables.\n\n\nDefinition 10.16 (Levels) The possible values of a factor. We are often comparing two or more levels of the factor, determining how specific levels impact the response variable.\n\n\nDefinition 10.17 (Treatment) A treatment refers to the complete experimental condition. That is, the set of all levels across all factors that are assigned to an experimental unit. In one-factor experiments, this is the levels of the single factor. In multifactor experiments, a treatment is a combination of the levels of the factors.\n\nIn an experiment, experimental units are observed after having been given the treatment. The response variable is measured, and compared across the different levels of the factors (or across the different treatments) to determine how the various treatments impact the outcome. In a well-structured experiment it is possible to conclude that the treatment causes a particular impact on the response variable, so long as the analysis takes into account the limitations of the experiment that was run.\n\nExample 10.8 (Sadie’s House Plant Growth) Sadie has become very interested in understanding the conditions under which house plants will thrive. Through some informal experimentation Sadie believes that the frequency of watering, type of fertilizer, and amount of sunlight are all important factors in the plant growth. Sadie is predominantly interested in determining the impact on the height of the plants.\n\nIndicate the experimental units, response variable, factor(s), possible level(s), and treatment(s) in this proposed experiment.\nIndicate further examples of response variables and factors that may be relevant to Sadie’s question of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this experiment, the units are the houseplants that Sadie is watching. The response variable will be the height of the plants (measured in, for instance, centimeters). The factors under consideration are the frequency of watering, type of fertilizer, and the amount of sunlight. Some possible levels for frequency of watering may be weekly, versus biweekly, versus monthly. Some possible levels for type of fertilizers may be natural compost, synthetic compost, or no fertilizer. Some possible levels for the amount of sunlight may be direct, indirect, or no sunlight. The treatments will be comprised of the combinations of the different levels for the three outlined factors (for instance, weekly watering, with natural compost, and direct sunlight; weekly watering, with natural compost, and indirect sunlight; etc.). If these levels are considered, then there will be a total of \\(3\\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) treatments under consideration.\nSadie may instead wish to measure something like leaf size, or stem width, or number of flowering plants. Each of these will produce different results, and will be useful for slightly different sets of considerations that Sadie may have. For other factors, Sadie may consider the pot size, or perhaps exposure to other stimulus.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.4.1 The Principles of Experimental Design\nJust as there were many different schemes for constructing a sample, there are also many different experimental designs. We will explore two common designs, but it is useful to first understand the guiding philosophy of experimentation in Statistics. There are three key factors that ensure that data collected from an experiment are useful for drawing scientific conclusions.\nFirst, is the idea of statistical control. It is not enough to know whether or not a particular treatment was followed by a positive response in the response variable. Instead, we require there to be some point of comparison. We call this point of comparison a statistical control. The idea is that we should always be comparing two or more treatments, even when our interest is in one particular treatment. If the treatment of interest is truly beneficial, we should be able to see this by comparison to other treatments. This way, we are able to ensure that the changes in the response variable that we see are related to our intervention, rather than by random chance. Sometimes we wish to see whether a particular treatment is effective, and there does not exist another treatment option that is a plausible candidate. In these cases, we often will take a treatment option to be “nothing at all”, which is to say no direct intervention on the given factor.13 In this way our control can still be used to see if our active intervention improves over doing nothing, when that is the alternative.\nBeyond statistical controls, experiments rely on randomization and replication. With randomization the idea is that the treatment that each experimental unit gets should be be randomly selected, without consideration of the specific unit. This way unintentional selection bias can be avoided within the groups. For instance, in a medical study, if you end up giving the experimental treatment to patients who are otherwise healthier, then you may expect that the experimental treatment will produce better results not because it was more effective, but because the patients who received it are the ones who are expected to have better outcomes irrespective of treatments. In addition to randomization, replication serves a central role in experimentation. The experiment should be conducted on a sufficient number of experimental units to ensure that random noise does not cloud conclusions. In particular, the sufficient sample size will ensure that the groups created via randomization will truly resemble each other, and the more units in the study, the better able you are to discern differences which exist between treatments. These principles can be put to work across various different experimental designs, depending on the specific experimental setup and constraints that are at play.\n\n\n10.4.2 Completely Randomized Design\nThe key question when defining an experimental design is how do the experimental units get assigned to the various treatment options. The most obvious choice is to randomly assign each unit to one of the treatment options, ignoring any underlying factors about the units. This is considered a completely randomized design.\n\nDefinition 10.18 (Completely Randomized Design) A completely randomized design is one in which the experimental units are randomly divided into groups, one for each treatment in the experiment. The treatments are then assigned to each of the groups, randomly selected for each.\n\nTypically we will consider an equal assignment of numbers of experimental units to each treatment option, though this is not strictly required. In the completely randomized design, we ignore anything that we may know about the experimental units beforehand.\n\nExample 10.9 (Sadies Houseplants: Completely Randomized Design) Sadie is going forth with experimentation to understand how different factors impact the height of house plants. Sadie decides to test treatments comprised of combinations of three factors: watering frequency (low frequency high volume versus high frequency low volume), fertilizer use (store bought fertilizer, versus homemade compost, versus no fertilizer), and sun exposure (direct sun exposure, versus indirect sun exposure, versus artificial light exposure). There are a total of \\(72\\) house plants, and Sadie wishes to use a completely randomized design.\nDescribe how this experiment can proceed as outlined by Sadie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a total of \\(2\\times3\\times 3 = 18\\) different treatment options. This means that for each treatment option, \\(\\dfrac{72}{18} = 4\\) houseplants should be assigned to it. We can form these \\(18\\) groups by sampling without replacement from the numbers \\(1\\) through \\(72\\), \\(4\\) at a time. Each number is assigned to one of the houseplants, and that forms the groups. For instance, the \\(18\\) groups may be:\n\n##       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n##  [1,]   66   48   47   38\n##  [2,]   17   34    1   15\n##  [3,]   14    8   68   71\n##  [4,]   35   26   62   42\n##  [5,]   37   11   61    2\n##  [6,]   72    4   19   67\n##  [7,]   41   64   18   25\n##  [8,]   69   39   10   70\n##  [9,]   50   53   30   33\n## [10,]   40   29   31   24\n## [11,]   16   49   32   36\n## [12,]   20   44   55   51\n## [13,]   22   65   59   54\n## [14,]   60    6   13   45\n## [15,]   23    3   52   46\n## [16,]    9    5   43   57\n## [17,]   58   28   63    7\n## [18,]   56   27   21   12\n\nThen, each of the groups gets assigned one of the treatments (low frequency/store bought/direct exposure; low frequency/store bought/indirect; low frequency/store bought/artificial; etc.). The treatments are given to the units, and then the heights are measured and recorded alongside the treatment that was assigned.\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least two shortcomings of completely randomized designs which we may wish to overcome. The first is that, in a completely randomized design, we may not be able to understand the impact on subpopulations of interest. Because randomization occurs without consideration of any other factor it is also not possible to directly analyze how treatment may impact the outcome variable segmented by these factors. While this is often not the primary question of interest, it will often be the case that having answers to these types of questions is desirable. Second, a completely randomized design may be less efficient at capturing the true effect of treatment, when treatment is mediated by other factors. If some groups of experimental units respond more favourably14 than others, ensuring that treatment allocation is split within these groups will lead to more precise estimates of the true treatment effect. As a result, we will often turn to more involved experimental designs to allocate treatment options.\n\n\n10.4.3 Randomized Block Design\nWhen we wished to exploit the structure of a population in sampling, making use of systematic differences, we divided the population into groups called strata on the basis of these traits. We can do the same thing with our experimental units forming blocks of experimental units. This blocking procedure gives rise to the randomized block design, an alternative to a completely randomized design.\n\nDefinition 10.19 (Randomized Block Design) A randomized block design assigns treatments randomly to all units within a block of experimental units. That is, the experimental units are separated into various blocks, and then within each block a completely randomized procedure is used.\n\nWith the use of the block design, you are able to assess not only is there an overall impact of treatment on the response variable, but also is this impact of treatment impacted15 through the blocking factor(s). This may be of scientific interest directly, and it also may help to ensure that random noise does not erode the ability to discern the true impact of treatment on the outcome. Typically, blocking factors will be natural factors which are suspected, or known, to influence the outcome, but which are of secondary interest to the experimenter.\n\nExample 10.10 (Sadie’s House Plants: Randomized Block Design) Of Sadie’s \\(72\\) plants, \\(18\\) of them are species of trees, \\(18\\) of them are species of vines or other crawlers, and the remaining \\(36\\) are flowering plants. If Sadie decides to test treatments comprised of combinations of three factors, watering frequency (low frequency high volume versus high frequency low volume), fertilizer use (store bought fertilizer, versus homemade compost, versus no fertilizer), and sun exposure (direct sun exposure, versus indirect sun exposure, versus artificial light exposure), how can a randomized block design to perform this experiment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the type of plant is the natural blocking factor. There are \\(18\\) different treatment options. This means that for each type of plant we perform a completely randomized design with \\(18\\) treatments. To do so, we can assign each of the trees to a single treatment option (there are \\(18\\) trees and \\(18\\) treatments, so this is a matter of simply randomizing the order of treatments and assigning one to each), we can assign each of the vines to a single treatment option (same as with the trees). For the flowering plants, there are \\(36\\) of them and \\(18\\) treatments, so each treatment should have two different plants. If we label the flowering plants \\(1\\) through \\(36\\), then we can simply draw without replacement from the numbers \\(1\\) through \\(36\\), \\(2\\) at a time. For instance, the \\(18\\) groups may be:\n\n##       [,1] [,2]\n##  [1,]    2   11\n##  [2,]   17    4\n##  [3,]   14   10\n##  [4,]   36   21\n##  [5,]   15    1\n##  [6,]    9   29\n##  [7,]    3   12\n##  [8,]   18    7\n##  [9,]    8   26\n## [10,]   16   35\n## [11,]   20   24\n## [12,]   22    5\n## [13,]   25   30\n## [14,]   23   19\n## [15,]   31   32\n## [16,]   27    6\n## [17,]   33   34\n## [18,]   28   13\n\nThen, each of the groups, within each of the blocks gets assigned one of the treatments (low frequency/store bought/direct exposure; low frequency/store bought/indirect; low frequency/store bought/artificial; etc.). The treatments are given to the units, and then the heights are measured and recorded alongside the block and the treatment that was assigned.",

    "section": "10.5 Data Description and Organization",
    "text": "10.5 Data Description and Organization\nWhether data are collected via sampling or experimentation, it is important to ensure that statistical principles are followed so that the observed data are representative of the population of interest and useful for accomplishing the goals of the statistical analysis. There is a substantial amount of statistical work which goes into ensuring that data collection is valid. Once valid data have been collected, we must do something with them. As previously discussed, there are typically four use cases for data. In these notes, our focus is on description and inference. Before we can use the data to describe patterns or conduct inference, we must first develop a shared language around what data are. Some of this has been informally introduced throughout our discussions thus far, however, the formal definition remains important for ensuring the foundation for statistical analyses.\n\nDefinition 10.20 (Variable) A characteristic or trait that can vary from one observation to the next is called a variable. Variables are the relevant pieces of information that are recorded in our data. We may have one or more variable recorded for each individual unit in our data.\n\n\nDefinition 10.21 (Observation) An observation is an individual piece of data. Our data are comprised of multiple observations across the various units in our sample (or on our experimental units).\n\nGenerally speaking, we make observations of variables, and together this forms our data. We use the data to answer the questions of interest or conduct our analyses. Every variable can be categorized as either a qualitative or quantitative variable. Qualitative variables are the non-numeric variables we observe, following categories or other less structured formats. Quantitative are numeric variables.\n\nDefinition 10.22 (Qualitative Variable) Any variable which is not numerical, such as those which fit into categories, are referred to as qualitative variables.\n\n\nDefinition 10.23 (Quantitative Variable) A quantitative variable is any variable which is described numerically.\n\nQuantitative variables can be either discrete or continuous. We saw this distinction when working with random variables, and the distinction is equivalent in the case of variables in a collected dataset as well. A variable is considered discrete if it can take on a (countable) number of listable values. A variable is considered continuous if it can take on any value from a defined range of values. Often times, just as with random variables, we make the distinction based on how we wish to think about the variables, rather than based on the theoretical underlying truth.16\n\nDefinition 10.24 (Discrete Variable) A quantitative variable which can take on values from a listable set. There are either finitely many options for the variable, or else a countably infinite number.\n\n\nDefinition 10.25 (Continuous Variable) A quantitative variable that can take on an uncountably infinite number of values is called continuous. Continuous variables can theoretically take on any value over a range of values, with the possibilities unable to be enumerated.\n\n\nExample 10.11 (Charles and Sadie Categorize Variables) Charles and Sadie realize that oftentimes there are many different ways of measuring qualities or traits that are of interest in a study. Upon realizing this, they begin to discuss a number of topics, considering how they may be measured.\nFor each of the following traits, discuss different options for variables that could represent the quantity discussed. For each, include possibilities which are qualitative and those which are quantitative, and specify whether the quantitative are discrete or continuous.\n\nCharles suggests that there are many ways of thinking about attained education.\nSadie, still thinking of plants, realizes that there may be many ways of thinking about the size of different plants.\nBased on an overheard conversation, Charles wonders how socioeconomic status may be measured.\nSadie, after enjoying a snack at the coffee shop, thinks about how we might measure the quality of food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttained education may be a qualitative variable if it is described via categories (for instance, high school, college diploma, undergraduate degree, etc.) It could almost be made to be quantitative if, for instance, you measured the total number of years that someone had formal education for. This would be a discrete quantitative variable.\nThe size of different plants could be qualitative by using subjective sizes (for instance, small, medium, and large). It is possible to measure these quantitatively as well, for instance by considering the height or volume of the plant. Likely height and volume both are best considered continuous values, but they may be discretized in certain datasets.\nSocioeconomic status can be a qualitative variable if, for instance, it is categorized on the basis of high/medium/low. To form a quantitative variable here you may consider household income, or wealth. Depending on how income or wealth are measured it may be discrete (for instance, counting the number of thousands of dollars) or continuous (if you listed exact dollar figures). This is an example of a variable which is always discrete, technically, but may be better treated as continuous.\nFood quality could be categorically rated (bad/average/good), or on a similar graded scale (S/A/B/C/D). Alternatively, the food could be subjectively graded numerically, giving for instance a star rating (out of \\(5\\)) or a rating out of \\(100\\). Likely these ratings would be discrete, but would be possible to come up with a continuous rating scale if that were desired.",

    "text": "10.6 From Data to Insight\nWhether data are collected via sampling or via experiments, the data themselves are not particularly useful for insight. If you are presented with a large dataset, it will likely not be possible to directly interpret the data, or communicate a message. Instead, we need to take the data as input and convert them to more useful products. The remainder of these notes will focus on ways of doing this within statistics.\nWe will focus both on how to summarize and communicate data that have been collected, and then how to begin gaining insight from these data. These are the first two roles of statistics, as introduced before: description and inference. All of the roles that statistics plays build from the idea that we have been able to collect data which are somehow relevant and representative of the underlying population of interest. We investigate the data, describe what has been observed in the sample, or attempt to conduct inference not because we are interested in the data themselves, but because we hope that the data will be reflective of the population of interest. We are not primarily interested in the statistics that we calculate, but in what these statistics say about the parameters of interest.\nIt is important, as we begin to explore how we can use data directly, to keep in mind that the entire statistical enterprise relies on having high quality data available. This relies on having measured the factors that we care about, in ways that are meaningful. It relies on representative samples and well-designed experiments. Without adhering to the principles discussed throughout this chapter, statistics cannot proceed in a way which addresses our goals. High quality data is not a substitute for statistical analysis, but it is a prerequisite for it.",

    "text": "11.1 The Purpose of Descriptive Statistics\nSuppose that you have collected a dataset, either through a sample of individuals or else through an experiment. You have likely done this with the understanding that these data provide useful insight into the world around you, that they will better inform decisions, or elucidate the truth about questions of interest. However, the data themselves provide very little information directly. Looking through a spreadsheet of numeric values is not a sound way to gather useful insight from data. Instead, we need to rely on pictorial and summary statistics, which take the data and describe or summarize the useful features that we are likely to care about.\nWe may use tables, charts, graphs, or other numerical summaries. The idea is that we want to use these tools to describe the distribution of the dataset. Recall from our study of probability that the distribution of a random variable is the probabilistic behaviour of the random quantity. The distribution of the dataset similarly refers to what values the data take on, and with what frequency those values occur.\nWe will continue with the same type of notation that has been used throughout our study of probability. A variable, when it has not yet been observed, will be represented by a capital letter, say \\(X\\). This notation will emphasize the fact that, until we have our sample, \\(X\\) can be thought of as unknown and random. Once we make observations for a variable, we denote these observations as \\(x\\). So, if we for instance, observe a sample of \\(100\\) individuals, we may observe \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{100}\\) for these individuals.\nIn general, we will use \\(x_i\\) to represent the \\(i\\)th observation of \\(X\\), in a sample of size \\(n\\). We may have multiple different variables that are observed for each individual. In this case, we may use \\(Y=y_1,\\dots,y_n\\) or \\(Z=z_1,\\dots,z_n\\). Generally, the ordering of the data will be arbitrary, which is to say there is no meaningful difference between individual \\(i=1\\) and \\(i=10\\), except that \\(i=1\\) happens to written first in the data. With this notation, we are able to begin considering how to display data for effective summarization. When describing or summarizing data that have been collected, we will consider numeric summaries, tabular summaries, as well as graphical summaries. For numeric and tabular summaries we are thinking about condensing the data that have been collected into key representations of these values. The information will often be presented in the form of data itself – which is to say, a table of summary numbers – however, it is done so in a way to highlight the key features of the larger dataset. The other alternative is to use graphical displays of information.",

    "text": "The Connection between Data and Random Variables\n\n\n\nWe previously thought of the collection and generation of data through both sampling and experimental design. The idea was that there was a population or a random process which we wanted to understand, but which could not be fully observed. Instead, we rely on being able to observe partial information from this, through our collected data. When we begin to discuss descriptive statistics, we will be considering the description of the data we have collected themselves – the experimental results or sample. The utility of describing these data stems primarily from the fact that, if we have followed best statistical practices while collecting these data, we should find that they are representative of the complete population. We will rarely be able to say that they are perfect representations for the population, but we are able to use our insight from them to draw conclusions about the population.\nBecause of this we constantly need to keep two quantities in our minds: the population and the sample. From our perspective, the sample is data, they are pieces of information that we have actually observed. The population, however, is random. It is unobservable, except through the sample or experiment. If we envision a numeric variable of interest, for instance, then once we have collected our sample we will have specific numeric values for this variable for those people in our sample. Which values we observe depends on which members of the population we happened to sample, and if we were to take another random sample, we would get different realizations for this. As a result, we can view sampling and observing as performing a statistical experiment. That is, there is some random quantity of interest, \\(X\\), which we only see a value for (\\(x\\)) once we take our sample. At that point, we know that \\(X = x\\).\nThis is precisely the notion of random variables introduced earlier on. That is, we view the quantities that we are going to measure as being random in the population, and our observations of them are realizations of the random variable. If we knew the distribution of these quantities then we could make different statements regarding the likelihood of observing various events. As a general rule, however, we do not know the exactly population distribution, and instead are trying to make inference about it through the use of the observed values. The notation introduced above emphasizes this point. We use lower case \\(x\\) to represent the values since lowercase letters represent observations that have actually been made. When discussing the unrealized values in the population, these can be expressed as capital letters.\nFor instance, suppose we conduct a survey of heights in some population. We might say: consider the height of an individual in the population to be a random quantity, denoted by \\(X\\). If we want to understand \\(E[X]\\) we can do so by first drawing a sample of \\(n\\) individuals from the population. If we draw these individuals independently, then we can think of each individual’s height as a random variable, \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\) independent and identically distributed from the distribution of heights in the population. Once we actually select and sample the values we observe \\(x_1,\\dots,x_n\\), where we are saying that \\(X_1 = x_1\\), \\(X_2 = x_2\\), and so on through to \\(X_n = x_n\\). At this point, we have seen actual realizations for \\(X_i\\), and we can use these realizations to try to draw conclusions about \\(E[X]\\). If we were to repeat this process many times over, each time we did it, we would see different values for \\(X_i\\), depending on who is included in our sample. Thus, \\(X_i\\) is a random variable.\n\n\n\n11.1.1 The Utility of Data Visualizations\nGraphical displays of information, or graphs, use visual representations of qualitative or quantitative data in order to provide an overview of key features of the distribution. If used well, this can allow for an efficient display of dense information in a manner which is easily interpretable. The type of informational display used depends, primarily, on two factors: what feature of the distribution are you trying to emphasize, and what type of data are you working with. Broadly, the types of graphics for qualitative data will differ from those for quantitative data. As multiple variables are collected, and the relationships between these different variables becomes the most interesting component of the distribution, we may combine both qualitative and quantitative variables together into a single display.\nHistorically, there has been a set of graphics which are considered standard, and which would be taught in an introductory course. We will understand the construction and utility of several, common visualizations. However, the landscape around data visualization has rapidly evolved in recent years. Aided by powerful and comparatively straightforward computer programs, far more creativity and artistry has been injected into the world of data visualizations. There are plenty of electronic visualizations which are interactive, there are people effectively using video or audio mediums to add to the display, and the constraints of “standard practice” have largely been overcome. This advancement in technology is not a universal gain, as with every possibility of doing something novel and effective with this technology there are at least an equal number of ways to do something which obscures the truth. Still, data visualization has emerged as a field in its own regard, one which combines statistics, design, and artistry together to great effect.1\nBecause of this, we will not cover the entire suite of historical figures. Graphs such as the stem-and-leaf plot or dot plot, while not entirely without purpose, were created prior to the advent of modern computer graphics. This enabled individuals to construct plots by hand, or with primitive early computers, and these were useful for those settings. The utility of by-hand plot construction is greatly diminished, and the advancement of graphics engines has rendered many of these plots essentially out-of-use. Rather than spend time learning or constructing these, we will instead focus on plots which remain in frequent use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Historic Utility of Data Visualizations\n\n\n\nThroughout history there have been many prominent illustrations of the utility of data visualizations. Two prominent examples that come to mind are Florence Nightingale, with her work on causes of death during the Crimean War2 and John Snow, with his work mapping an 1854 cholera outbreak in London.3\nFlorence Nightingale, a British nurse who worked during the Crimean war, recognized that little was being done to prevent illness transmission throughout the military. She also recognized the importance of conveying the information in ways that would be properly seen and processed by those in positions of decision-making authority. Noting that there was a tendency to overlook tables of figures and data, she instead proposed several graphical displays of the information which would more convincingly illustrate the problem. This served as an important step in the use of data visualizations to tell compelling stories with data.\nJohn Snow was an English physician who was an early proponent of the germ-theory of disease. This was proposed as an alternative to the then dominant miasma theory, which more or less attributed disease to “bad air”. After a cholera outbreak in London in 1854, John Snow mapped out the houses in the are which had individuals sick with cholera. Using this graphic, it became evident that the cases of cholera were clustering around a particular water pump on broad street, lending strong evidence to the thought that this was the cause of transmission. This stands as a foundational study in epidemiology which informs practice to this day.4\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Famous historical graphics produced by Florence Nightingale and John Snow which served great utility in improving health at their time, and stand as an important recognition of the power of visualizing data in a way that renders the message easily interpretable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) One of Florence Nightingale’s data visualizations demonstrating death of soldiers during the Crimean War. The blue area in these plots demonstrates the rate of deaths of preventible illness over the course of the war, the red/pink areas represent deaths from wounds, and the black areas represent all other causes. This clearly demonstrates the outsized impact that the policies had on the health of soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The map produced by John Snow illustrating the cholera outbreak. Infected areas are illustrated by the dark shaded rectangles, which appear to cluster around the pump, indicated near the center of the map on broad street. As households move further and further from this central location, the number of cases evidently drops off, providing a strong indication that this may be the cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside of graphical summaries, we will also consider numeric summaries. These summaries are typically useful for describing particular features of the data which may be of direct interest. These types of summaries are analogous to the summaries we saw for random variables where we condensed probability mass functions into measures of location and measures of variability. When we did this, we lost much of the nuance of the probabilistic behaviour, however, it became far easier to have a general sense of how a random variable will behave. The same concerns will exist in summarizing data. The more we summarize, the more information we will lose, however, the more we will be able to fully appreciate the numeric summaries that we do have. Descriptive statistics is often about balancing these competing interests.\nAs previously mentioned, the tools that we will use to summarize data will depend primarily on the type of data that we have. The summaries available to summarize the behaviour of a qualitative variable differ from those available for quantitative variables. We will begin with a discussion of summarizing qualitative variables.",

    "section": "11.2 Descriptive Statistics for Qualitative Variables",
    "text": "11.2 Descriptive Statistics for Qualitative Variables\nQualitative variables are those which are not numeric. As a discipline descending from math, statistics centers the ability to quantify information in a large number of its techniques. This presents a challenge with the tools that we have to summarize qualitative data. While the modern tendency to fuse graphics and art has enabled graphical displays of qualitative information, at its core, the process of descriptive statistics for qualitative data relies on first translating the qualitative information into numeric information. While the exact procedure for doing this will depend on the exact data in question5 the most common method for extracting numeric representations from qualitative data is through the use of a frequency distribution.\n\nDefinition 11.1 (Frequency Distribution) The frequency distribution summarizes the distinct values that a variable can take on, along with the number of observations that equalled each value. The frequency distribution can be thought of as the distribution of drawing a single observation from the sample at random.\n\nThe frequency distribution is a useful and intuitive way of summarizing a qualitative variable, numerically. In order to find the frequency distribution, the categories of the variable are listed through, and then the number of observations in each category are tallied up. This can be reported in tabular form, similar to contingency tables6 or graphically through the use of bar plots.7 When expressed in tabular form, it can be useful to work out the relative frequencies in addition to (or in place of) the counts, giving the proportion of observations for each category. This gives added context to the raw numbers themselves.\n\nExample 11.1 (Charles and Sadie Count Coffee Orders) Sitting in the coffee shop, Charles and Sadie begin to wonder how common the various different coffee orders are. They decide to categorize each order into one of the following categories, based on what was ordered: coffee only, coffee with food, coffee and non-coffee drinks, coffee with food and non-coffee drinks, food only, food with non-coffee drinks, and non-coffee drinks only. Over the course of an hour observing they collect the following data.\n\n\n\nCoffee + Food + Drink\nCoffee\nCoffee\nCoffee + Drink\nCoffee\n\n\n\n\nCoffee + Food\nCoffee\nCoffee + Drink\nDrink\nFood\n\n\n\n\nCoffee\nFood + Drink\nFood + Drink\nCoffee\nFood\n\n\n\nBased on these data:\n\nWrite down the tabular frequency distribution for these data.\nWrite down the relative frequencies for these data.\nWhich order was observed the most? The least?\nWhat is the most common order in the population?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will complete (a) and (b) together in a single table. First note that there are \\(6\\) realizations of coffee, \\(1\\) of drink, \\(2\\) of food, \\(2\\) of coffee with drink, \\(1\\) of coffee with food, \\(1\\) of coffee with food and drink, and \\(2\\) of food and drink.\nThis leads to a total of \\(15\\) orders in the hour, and so taken together we can write down the following frequency distribution.\n\n\n\n\nOrder\nFrequency (Count)\nRelative Frequency\n\n\n\n\nCoffee\n\\(6\\)\n\\(6/15 = 0.4\\)\n\n\nDrink\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1/15 = 0.06666\\)\n\n\nFood\n\\(2\\)\n\\(2/15 = 0.13333\\)\n\n\nCoffee + Drink\n\\(2\\)\n\\(2/15 = 0.13333\\)\n\n\nCoffee + Food\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1/15 = 0.06666\\)\n\n\nCoffee + Food + Drink\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1/15 = 0.06666\\)\n\n\nFood + Drink\n\\(2\\)\n\\(2/15 = 0.13333\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe most frequent order was coffee alone. This was observed by \\(6\\) customers. The least frequent orders were drinks alone, coffee with food, and coffee with food and another drink. These were observed \\(1\\) time each.\nThese data are from a sample, and by all accounts, not even a random sample. It is important to always keep in mind that there is a difference between population parameters and sample statistics. It is possible that coffee is the most common order in the morning, and that food is far more common later on throughout the day: if the hour watched was in the morning, that could explain this pattern at present. We are only able to describe what we observed, rather than infer about the population, based on this summary.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo express the frequency distribution in graphical form, we typically will make use of a bar plot. A bar plot is a graphic which along one axis (typically the x-axis, though horizontal plots exist) the distinct values of a qualitative variable are listed. Then, along the other axis, the frequencies of those are listed. The values are displayed based on rectangles with equal width for each category, and with a height that goes out to the value that of the observed variable. Then, to read the bar plot, we observe which rectangles are taller (corresponding to more prevalent values in the sample) or smaller (corresponding to values which were more rare in the sample). We can compare across categories, or even back solve for the entire frequency distribution.\n\nExample 11.2 (Charles and Sadie Count Coffee Orders, Representatively) With the understanding of the flawed methodology that they exhibited on their first attempt, Charles and Sadie decide to perform a random sample to collect data on the different coffee orders made at the local coffee shop. To this end, they randomly select different days of the week, different hours of the day, and then they observe all of the orders that come in over that time. Sadie produces the following bar plot based on their collected data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this plot, answer the following questions.\n\nWhich is the most common order in the sample, and what is the frequency with which it is ordered?\nIf there are a total of \\(60\\) orders, what is the relative frequency of the least common order?\nHow many orders had any coffee drink in the order?\nDescribe the overall frequency distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sample, there are \\(24\\) orders of Food + Drink, which is the most common order.\nThe least common order is a coffee + food + drink, which occurred \\(\\dfrac{1}{60} = 0.01666\\) proportion of the time in the sample.\nIn total there were \\(11 + 5 + 9 + 1 = 26\\) orders with coffee in them. This accounts for \\(\\dfrac{26}{60} = 0.433333\\) of all orders.\nThe most common order was food and a non-coffee drink, which was more than twice as common as the next most frequent order of just a coffee. It was very unlikely for people to get all three categories of item. People got coffee with food more frequently than food alone, drinks alone, or coffee with drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever we present a descriptive statistic, be that a numerical summary or a graphical summary, it is always worth asking the question: “what are we trying to highlight?” In the case of frequency distributions, we are typically thinking about highlighting the total counts and cross category comparisons of the different values. Often times these are comparisons that we wish to make and using a bar chart for this is quite effective. However, depending on what we are trying to communicate, there may be alternative choices that make sense to make. It is always important to ensure that your visualization or summary is informed by the goal of your presentation, rather than by outside guidance. Descriptive statistics is fundamentally a field predicated upon communication. With that said, any time that we are presented with an observed qualitative variable, the frequency distribution completely contains all of the information in the data. It may not always be the most useful presentation of the data, however, it is a way of summarizing everything that we know about that variable alone. As a result, deep comfort with frequency distributions will be instrumental to effective communication and description of qualitative data.\n\nExample 11.3 (Charles finds Palmer’s Penguins) While daydreaming one day, Charles imagines the chance to work at the Palmer Station in Antarctica, researching penguins. The day dreams lead to a rich imagination, envisioning all species of penguins across the various islands. As the day dreams wind-on, Charles begins to count the penguins, leading to the following observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiscoe\nDream\nTorgersen\n\n\n\n\nAdelie\n44\n56\n52\n\n\nChinstrap\n0\n68\n0\n\n\nGentoo\n124\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing these data8 answer the following.\n\nWrite down the complete frequency distribution for penguin species.\nWrite down the complete frequency distribution for the inhabited island.\nDescribe or sketch the bar plots for each of the relevant frequency distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get the distribution for species, we add up along each row to get the total observed data into a frequency table.

Despite this change in process, the frequency distribution remains an impactful concept in summarizing and describing data which have been observed.\n\n11.3.1 The Frequency Distribution for Quantitative Variables\nIf the quantitative variables that have been observed are discrete, the frequency distribution can proceed in an exactly equivalent way as in the qualitative case. If, however, we have quantitative variables our frequency distribution needs to be adjusted. The issue is that, if a variable of interest is continuous, we do not expect to ever observe the same value more than once. This renders the frequency distribution to look something like a broken comb9, rather than having any interesting features. To avoid this happening, we consider the process of binning quantitative variables, where values are placed into bins or classes, consisting of intervals, in order to better understand the structure of the frequency distribution.\n\nDefinition 11.2 (Data Binning) Data binning is a (pre-processing) step of a data analysis in which quantitative variables (typically continuous ones) are placed into bins or classes based on their underlying value. If a quantitative variable \\(x\\) takes values in the interval \\([a,b]\\), then the interval \\([a,b]\\) is divided into several sub-intervals, say \\([a,p_1], [p_1, p_2], \\dots, [p_{k-1},b]\\). Then, each observed value for \\(x\\), \\(x_i\\) is placed into its corresponding bin, before the data are analyzed.\n\nAs a general rule, bins should be selected either based on some subject-matter justification (such that they are meaningful to the underlying data), or else to accurately balance the trade-offs of smoothness and accuracy in the frequency distribution. That is, we want to select enough bins so that the true behaviour of the data are correctly represented, while not selecting so many that noise and variability are the primary conclusions to be drawn from the summaries. Plenty of methods to select the number of bins have been proposed, and in most software packages for devising frequency distributions various techniques will be implemented. It is worth ensuring that the technique selected for any particular use case accurately summarizes and describes the available data. Generally, \\(10-30\\) bins will likely suffice, though fewer or more may be necessary in certain situations.\nThe only hard-and-fast rules of binning is that, first, bins should10 be of equal width. That is, if you take \\([0,1)\\) to be the first bin in your data, then every bin should be of length \\(1\\). Second, bins should11 span the complete range of your observed data. If you have points ranging from \\(0\\) to \\(1000\\), every value between \\(0\\) and \\(1000\\) should be contained in some bin. Once binned, quantitative frequency distributions can be described in exactly the same manner that qualitative were.\n\nExample 11.4 (Charles and Sadie Count Coffee Order Items) After their success in understanding the makeup of different coffee orders, Charles and Sadie set their sights on understanding the quantity of items ordered by customers at the coffee shop. The observe customers for an hour and consider the total number of items each customer orders. The following observations are made.\n\n\n\n3\n1\n4\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n2\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n\n\n\nBased on these data, answer the following questions.\n\nWrite down the frequency distribution for the number of items on each order. Include the relative frequency for each observation.\nIs data binning required for this frequency distribution? Describe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the relevant categories are \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). We get\n\n\n\n\nOrder Size\nFrequency (Count)\nRelative Frequency\n\n\n\n\n1\n\\(6\\)\n\\(6/15 = 0.4\\)\n\n\n2\n\\(4\\)\n\\(4/15 = 0.266666\\)\n\n\n3\n\\(3\\)\n\\(3/15 = 0.333333\\)\n\n\n4\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1/15 = 0.066666\\)\n\n\n5\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0/15 = 0\\)\n\n\n6\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1/15 = 0.066666\\)\n\n\n\n\nNo. These data are discrete, and given that there are only \\(6\\) total categories there would be no particular utility to binning here. If the data were continuous, or were discrete with sufficiently many categories so as to be better treated as continuous than discrete, then binning would be pertinent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.5 (Charles and Sadie Count Coffee Order Values) As a final way of understanding the distribution of different coffee orders, Charles and Sadie decide to observe the total cost of orders for various customers coming through the store. The following observations are made over the course of an hour.\n\n\n\n$2.25\n$2.20\n$5.13\n\n\n\n\n$1.30\n$2.02\n$4.91\n\n\n\n\n$1.64\n$3.49\n$0.98\n\n\n\n\n$2.97\n$3.84\n\n\n\n\n$5.30\n$2.53\n\n\n\n\n$2.45\n$4.66\n\n\n\nBased on these data, answer the following questions.\n\nDescribe the considerations that should be made for bin sizes. Would a bin size of \\(\\$0.10\\) be reasonable? What about one that is \\(\\$3.00\\)?\nSuppose that a bin size of \\(\\$0.50\\) is used, starting at \\(0.50\\). Write down the frequency distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smallest observed value is \\(0.98\\) and the largest observed value is \\(5.30\\). That means that our bins should encapsulate both of these end points, and be evenly spaced throughout. Because there are only \\(15\\) data points, we likely want fewer bins rather than more, to ensure that our bins are not predominantly empty or with single items. If we use \\(0.10\\), we would require \\(43\\) bins at least to include all of the data. This would guarantee that most bins were empty, and is far too small of a divide to be useful. If we used \\(\\$3.00\\), we would span the full range in \\(2\\) to \\(3\\) bins. This is likely not particularly informative either, this time giving too little of a breakdown of the various values.\nThe following is the relevant frequency distribution.\n\n\n\n\nBin\nFrequency (Count)\nRelative Frequency\n\n\n\n\n\\([0.50,1.00)\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1/15 = 0.066666666\\)\n\n\n\\([1.00,1.50)\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1/15 = 0.066666666\\)\n\n\n\\([1.50,2.00)\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1/15 = 0.066666666\\)\n\n\n\\([2.00,2.50)\\)\n\\(4\\)\n\\(4/15 = 0.266666666\\)\n\n\n\\([2.50,3.00)\\)\n\\(2\\)\n\\(2/15 = 0.133333333\\)\n\n\n\\([3.00,3.50)\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1/15 = 0.066666666\\)\n\n\n\\([3.50,4.00)\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1/15 = 0.066666666\\)\n\n\n\\([4.00,4.50)\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0/15 = 0\\)\n\n\n\\([4.50,5.00)\\)\n\\(2\\)\n\\(2/15 = 0.0.1333333\\)\n\n\n\\([5.00,5.50)\\)\n\\(2\\)\n\\(2/15 = 0.0.1333333\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the tabular representation of the frequency distribution for quantitative variables is a relevant summary, and one which serves a key role, we will see that there are far more ways of summarizing the behaviour of quantitative variables. Before that, however, it is worth determining how to graphically represent a quantitative frequency distribution, through the use of histograms.\n\n\n11.3.2 Using Histograms for Visualizing Quantitative Frequency Distributions\nIf we expand the idea of a barplot to quantitative variables, we get the histogram. A histogram is primarily useful for displaying the distribution of a single quantitative variable. To do so, the horizontal (x-axis) represents the value of the variable of interest, and the corresponding vertical (y-axis) represents the frequency with which that value occurs in the data. That is, higher points correspond to more frequently occurring values, and lower points correspond to less frequently occurring values.\nIf the data are binned, then the histogram displays counts within the bins rather than at the values themselves. Just as with a barplot, the graphic proceeds by drawing a rectangle, with a height equal to the frequency, and a width equal to the length of the interval. The larger the rectangle, the more points that were observed in that range.\nSometimes, instead of having the y-axis measure the frequency, we may take it to measure the density of falling in that range. The density is given by the probability that a value in that range is observed, divided by the width of the range. For instance, if \\(10\\) of \\(50\\) observations fell between \\(2\\) and \\(4\\), then the height of the rectangle using the density representation would be \\(\\dfrac{10/50}{4-2} = 0.1\\). So long as every bin has an equal width, the same relative heights will occur whether using the frequency or density versions.\nA key difference between histograms and barplots is that, since the data in a histogram are numeric, we typically consider the x-axis to be continuous. This means that the bins of the histograms expand along the complete axis, and adjacent bins will touch one another. In a barplot there is separation between these categories since there are no values between the two of them.\n\nExample 11.6 (Charles and Sadie Plot the Coffee Orders) Charles and Sadie realize that to make sure that they have a full understanding of the total spend that customers have at the coffee shop they should likely collect more data, and data which are spread out randomly over times of the day and days of the week. As a result, they conduct another random survey. Once collected, both Charles and Sadie produce histograms for the totals, as seen here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the approximate bin width used by Charles? By Sadie?\nDescribe the frequency distribution as depicted by both histograms.\nDoes one histogram do a better job than the other at representing these data? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that in every dollar along the x-axis, Sadie has two histogram rectangles. This suggests a bin width of approximately \\(0.50\\). For Charles, there are \\(5\\) per dollar, and as a result, the bin width will be approximately \\(0.20\\).\nBoth plots demonstrate that the most frequent order totals are comparatively low, with values around \\(\\$1.00\\). With the histogram provided by Sadie, the order totals are fairly uniform between \\(1\\) and \\(3.50\\), with a small spike around \\(2.00\\). Following that, the order totals are fairly uniform between \\(3.50\\) and \\(6\\), before falling again above \\(6.00\\). The patterns in the histogram from Charles are similar, but with slightly more information. While there is a fairly uniform distribution of observations beyond \\(3.40\\), and then a dip beyond \\(6.00\\), for the smaller values there is an oscillating pattern. They spike around \\(1.00\\), \\(2.00\\), \\(3.00\\), and \\(3.40\\), with the other values being appreciably lower. Still, the lower values are definitely higher on average than the higher values, with roughly equivalent breakpoints as was seen with Sadie’s.\nThe preferred histogram here will likely depend on the use case for the data. The data that Charles is demonstrating provides more specific information, however, it is possible that this added information is more noise than useful. It would be interesting to look at, for instance, the prices of various items at the store to see if there was a reason for the peaks: otherwise, it could be seen to be random variation that is not particularly noisy. Sadie’s pattern, by contrast, is far more explicable, but it gains this by smoothing over a lot of the fine details within the graphic. Perhaps a graph that balances these two would be more suitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram is a useful graphical display since it succinctly summarizes the entire distribution of a particular variable. You can easily see the range of the data, the points which came up frequently in your observations, those which were rare, and how this behaviour is expressed throughout. It will allow you to readily view points that appear to not fit the trend of the rest of your data, and to investigate a single variable at a glance.\nWhen constructing a histogram, the primary decision that needs to be made is how many bins you should use, or equivalently, how large your bins should be. As you have more and more observations you can typically get away with using smaller bin sizes as, even at the smaller sizes, you likely still have observations that fall into the given intervals. Just as with the discussion on data binning, software that implement histogram construction often provide several techniques for choosing a bin size, or the number of bins, in order to best summarize the data. It is worth considering these for the problem at hand, and ensuring that the choice that is made illustrates the data faithfully.\n\n\n11.3.3 Characteristics of the Frequency Distribution\nWhile we will typically focus on graphically displaying the distribution of a dataset, it is useful to consider what it is specifically that we are trying to display, and what are the properties of a dataset which are of interest to us? We are primarily concerned with three properties of a distribution: the location, the spread, and the skewness. We have seen all three of these concepts when discussing random variables, but their importance becomes central when summarizing data. More concretely, when describing data we want to make sure to describe the shape of the distribution, the centre of the distribution, and the spread of a distribution. Each of these three concepts have different measures or components which, when taken together, serve as a more complete description of the frequency distribution.\n\nDefinition 11.3 (Shape (of a Distribution)) The shape of the data distribution refers to the general pattern of points that are observed in the specific dataset. Typically, the shape of a distribution is decomposed into the modality and skewness of the distribution.\nThe modality refers to the number of peaks that are visible in the distribution: points that are higher than the surrounding points. A distribution is unimodal with one peak, bimodal with two peaks, or multimodal with more than two.\nThe skewness corresponds to how symmetric (or not) a distribution is. If a distribution can be mirrored around its center, with the same behaviour above and below the central point, we describe it as symmetric. If a distribution has differing tail-behaviour, extending out in a direction, we say that it is skewed. A distribution that has a long-tail to the right is called right skewed or positive skewed, where a distribution that has a long-tail to the left is called left skewed or negative skewed.\n\nTo describe the shape of a frequency distribution, we describe the modality and the skewness of it. These two features combine to give a good sense of the general picture of the distribution, such that someone should be able to sketch a reasonable approximation to the frequency distribution from the description. However, there are many distributions with the same modality and skewness, which are otherwise quite distinct. To understand these differences, it is useful to turn towards measures of location, or central tendency, and measures of spread, or variability.\n\nDefinition 11.4 (Location (Central Tendency)) The location of data, also referred to as the central tendency, is a description of where observations in the dataset tended to fall around. This can be measured as the sample mode, the sample median, or the sample mean, and is typically summarized using all three. Measures of central tendency give a sense as to where the middle of the data were, where various definitions of middle can be used.\n\nJust as with random variables, measures of location come about by asking what we “expect” to see in the data. When we are discussing samples, rather than random variables, we are instead answering questions around what we saw on average, or what we tended to see in the observed data. Location summaries are quite common, and quite intuitive. You may indicate the most common value, which is the sample mode, or the overall average, the sample mean. However, just as with random variables, the measures of central tendency only tell a partial story. The other key feature of the data is the spread.\n\nDefinition 11.5 (Spread (Variability)) The spread of data is a measure of how separated the data are, and how they tend to be spaced around the location. The spread can be captured using particular measurements, such as the sample variance, sample IQR, or sample range as was done with random variables. The may also refer to the tail behaviour of the data, which looks at how likely values are as they move further and further from the center of the data.\nA distribution is said to be heavy-tailed if points that are far from the measures of central tendency are quite frequent in the data, and is said to be light-tailed otherwise. These concepts can be formalized more rigorously, however, it is often taken to be an informal rather than formal check.12\n\nThe spread of the data gives a measure as to how concentrated (or not) the observations were. Data which are widely spread out will have large measures of variability compared to those which are less spread out. When combined with the measures of central tendency, as well as a description of the shape of the distribution, it is possible to develop a fairly clear picture of the behaviour of the data, summarized rather succinctly.\n\n\n11.3.4 The Shape of a Distribution\nAs indicated, the shape of a distribution is primarily defined by the modality and skewness of the distribution. That is to say, when asked to describe the shape of the distribution, you should report on the modality (including the values of the modal points), as well as on the symmetry or skewness of the distribution.\n\nDefinition 11.6 (Modality) Modality refers to the number of local peaks that a frequency distribution has. That is, the number of times that there are values in the frequency distribution that are higher than those in close proximity to them. If looking at the histogram we are looking for the number of “hills” that exist. Modality is classified by the number, and values, of the different modal points.\nA distribution with one local maximum is considered unimodal. A distribution with two local maxima is considered bimodal. A distribution with three or more local maxima is considered multimodal.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that a frequency distribution may have only one mode, but may be multimodal. That is, we do not require each of the peaks to tend to equate to exactly the same level to be considered peaks. Instead, we compare them to only the points that are around them. This way, we can capture the idea of local behaviour indicating that certain regions appeared more frequently than others around them, which is often of direct interest to us. It is also important to recognize that, if reading modal points from a histogram, the number of breaks and the number of observations will likely change the perception of the modality. There will often be judgment calls when discussing the number of modes that a histogram exhibits, with reasonable disagreement being possible. As a general rule, you should not consider small noisy peaks adjacent to others to be additional modal points, unless there is a good reason to do so. If you envision drawing a smooth line over the full distribution of data, the modal points will come where you draw the crests of the hills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying the Modality of Distributions\n\n\n\n\nUnimodal\nData which exhibit a single peak, whether this is in the center or off to one side, are considered to be unimodal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBimodal\nData which exhibit exactly two peaks are considered to be bimodal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultimodal\nData which exhibit more than two peaks are considered to be multimodal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond modality is the skewness. Skewness, or conversely, symmetry is a way of describing the tail behaviour of a distribution. As you move away from the central values, the most common values, or the middle values of a distribution, the tails are the values that are far from where you started but still present in the data. In general, if the tails going to the positive and negative directions look similar, the data are said to be symmetric. Otherwise, the data are said to be skewed. We differentiate skewness based on the direction that the tail travels.\n\nDefinition 11.7 (Skewness) Data which are nonsymmetric are said to be skewed. The lack of symmetry can be identified by the behaviour of the tails of a distribution, differentiating between positive (or right) skew and negative (or left) skew.\nData are right-skewed if the tail is longer to the righthand side of the figure. Data are left-skewed if the tail is longer to the lefthand side of the figure.\n\nSometimes skewness is quite dramatic, being very evident in which direction the skew will be. In other cases the data are not symmetric, but are also not evidently skewed. In these settings it is worth investigating the data in slightly more depth to try to understand whether the lack of symmetry (or skewness) can be explained based on some particular values, and if the remaining data exhibit a more predictable pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying the Skewness of a Distribution\n\n\n\nTo identify whether data are symmetric, right-skewed, or left-skewed, you consider the beahviour of the tails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, when asked to identify the shape of a distribution, you are being asked about the key features of the distribution: how many modal points are there, and where are those located, and what is happening with the tails of the distribution? Beyond these points, discussion of the shape of the distribution largely centers around giving added context to the nuance with the provided descriptors. For instance, if the skewness is not partiuclarly pronounced, that can be discussed. If modal points are not clearly delineated, that should be acknowledged. Once described, an individual should be able to sketch out a rough distributional curve that approximately mirrors the behaviour of the frequency distribution.\n\nExample 11.7 (Sadie Records the Timing of Hockey Events) Sadie, being a big sports fan, has started to record and analyze the timing of different events throughout the game. Charles decides to help out by producing histograms for the time that these events happen at. Sadie records the time that faceoffs occur at, that goals are scored at, and when penalties are taken.13 The histograms are provided below.\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the shape of the distribution of goal times in NHL regular season games.\nDescribe the shape of the distribution of faceoff times in NHL regular season games.\nDescribe the shape of the distribution of penalty times in NHL regular season games.\nIndicate any difficulties in describing these distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution is approximately bimodal, with modal points at approximately \\(30\\) and \\(60\\) minutes. The distribution is non-symmetric, since higher frequency of goals are scored near the end of the game than at the beginning, making it a left-skewed distribution. If the final bin is ignored, which may be reasonable given that the final minute of game has different dynamics than other times, the distribution appears roughly symmetric.\nThis distribution is approximately multimodal. The modes occur at \\(0\\), \\(20\\), and \\(40\\) minutes. Every period starts with a faceoff, and as a result, every game will have faceoffs taken at exactly \\(0\\), \\(20\\), and \\(40\\) minutes into it. There are some points which may be described as modal points around \\(10\\) minutes and around \\(30\\) minutes, but these are far less obvious than the other three. The distribution is non-symmetric owing to the lack of a modal point at \\(60\\) minutes. Because of this, we may say that there is a slight positive skew to the distribution. It seems more sensible, however, to indicate that in the absence of the three modal points that are clearly explicable, it is a roughly symmetric distribution that is approximately uniform across the whole range.\nThe modality of the penalty timings is difficult to describe. It may be reasonable to describe this as multimodal with modes appear around \\(20\\), \\(25\\), \\(38\\), \\(45\\), and \\(60\\). However, this may also represent some histogram noise that is better to smooth over. In that case, perhaps you suggest that the three modal points are around \\(20\\), and \\(40\\), and around \\(50\\). The distribution does not exhibit perfect symmetry, owing to the spike near the end of the games, however, there seems to be little apparent skewness in the distribution. With the points near the end of the game removed, it is a mostly symmetric plot, however, with those points in there is some negative skewness indicated.\nWhile the first two distributions are fairly clear to describe in shape, the penalties are a lot less evident. This becomes even more apparent when we consider how the number of bins selected impacts the overall shape of the distribution. Consider the following histograms (if online, you can click to enlarge them). With few bins, this distribution appears to be approximately symmetric with a single mode in the middle of the distribution. As more and more are added, the pattern remains rather similar until a within-period distribution emerges: the first period has a negative skew, unimodal distribution, the second a fairly uniform symmetric distribution, and the third a bimodal negative skew distribution. As we continue to add bins we see histograms that look similar to the one we considered, before getting to a point that looks more or less consistent throughout the range, with seemingly random spikes at various times. These demonstrate the importance of bin size selection, and illustrate the challenges that can occur when trying to describe real-world data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.5 Measures of Location\nThe shape of a distribution is described in fairly general terms. If you know that a distribution is right-skewed and unimodal, with a peak around \\(10\\), there are many plausible distributions that could be drawn for what this would look like. While often times this shape captures the most pertinent information for a distribution, sometimes we require more. To add specificity, we can consider the location or central tendency of a frequency distribution. The main measures of location are the sample mean, sample median, and sample mode. These correspond to the exact quantities that we saw in random variables, this time computed on the data directly.\n\nDefinition 11.8 (Sample Mode) The sample mode is the most common value observed in a dataset. When there are more than one value which appear equally often, these are all consider modes. If a variable is binned, we may define the mode in terms of the classes rather than the specific value, depending on the context.\n\nWhichever value appears most often is given as the mode. This is analogous to the most probable value for a random variable. The sample mode and the modal points are related to one another. When discussing modality, we contented ourselves with approximations, considering values near the actual modal points when defining the peaks. When discussing the sample mode we are looking for a specific value, or a specific category of values, which actually gives the most frequent value.\n\nDefinition 11.9 (Sample Median) The sample median is the middle point after ordering the observed data. If there are an even number of observations it is the mean between the two middle points. If we order the observed data as \\(x_{(1)} \\leq x_{(2)} \\leq \\cdots \\leq x_{(n)}\\), then the median is defined as \\[\\text{Median} = \\begin{cases}\n    x_{([n+1]/2)} & n \\text{ is odd}; \\\\\n    \\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(x_{(n/2)} + x_{(n/2 + 1)}\\right) & n \\text{ is even}.\n\\end{cases}\\] That is, it is the middle point when there is an odd number of observations in the data, and it is the average of the two middle points when there are an even number of observations.\n\nThe sample median has the same interpretation as the population median we previously saw. There will always be \\(50\\%\\) of the observations which are less than or equal to the median, and always $50% of the observations which are greater than or equal to the median. This puts the median as the center of the distribution, when measured in terms of frequencies.\n\nDefinition 11.10 (Sample Mean) The sample mean is the standard arithmetic average. If we observe \\(x_1,\\dots,x_n\\), then we write the mean as \\(\\overline{x}\\), and this is calculated as \\[\\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.\\]\n\nThe mean is a very commonly reported measure for the center of a distribution. it is also referred to as the average. Just as with random variables and the expected value, the mean can be viewed as balancing the mass of observations. If you place equal mass at each of the observations, then the mean would be the point which balances a seesaw holding those masses.\n\nExample 11.8 (Charles’ Penguin Bill Lengths) Continuing on in day-dreaming adventures at the Palmer Station in Antarctica, Charles envisions recording the bill lengths of a random sampling of the penguins that are observed. These day-dreamed values are recorded, and Charles would look to summarize the general behaviour of these points, considering the measures of central tendency of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49.0\n37.8\n45.8\n39.0\n43.2\n48.8\n37.8\n49.1\n40.9\n37.3\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the sample mean of these data?\nWhat is the sample median of these data?\nWhat is the sample mode of these data?\nWhat is the expected value for the bill length in the population? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the sample mean, we compute \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{x} &= \\frac{1}{10}(49.0 +  37.8 + 45.8 + 39.0 + 43.2 + 48.8 +  37.8 + 49.1 + 40.9 + 37.3) \\\\\n&= \\frac{428.7}{10} \\\\\n&= 42.87\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFor the median, we first consider ordering the values in ascending order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37.3\n37.8\n37.8\n39.0\n40.9\n43.2\n45.8\n48.8\n49.0\n49.1\n\n\n\nThen we note that the two middle values are \\(40.9\\) and \\(43.2\\), so we get that \\[\\text{Median} = \\frac{1}{2}(40.9 + 43.2) = 42.05.\\]\n\nThe only repeated value in these data is \\(37.8\\), and so that makes it the mode.\nWe do not know, given this information, what the population expected value will be. We do not have access to enough information to compute the parameter, and instead must rely on using only our sample statistics. These are measures of the data that are observed, rather than the full population.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three common measures of central tendency will often be explicitly computed and reported when access to the data is directly available. These can also be approximately indicated using a histogram of a frequency distribution. The mode will be the bin with the highest frequency, or equivalently, the highest point on the histogram. The median will be found in the bin which contains the middle observation. This can be challenging to find exactly without counting, but an approximation is likely possible. The mean will be found in the bin which balances the mass of the distribution. You can imagine asking yourself: where would the fulcrum need to go in order to balance a seesaw with these weights on it. The answer will tell you where the mean is. Note that this process, without explicit observations, will not be exact. Instead, it is in our interest to attempt to find approximately correct solutions to these questions, getting a general sense of the measures of central tendency from a graphical representation.\n\nExample 11.9 (Unknown Histogram Markings) Charles wanted to help Sadie with the hockey analysis from before. To do so, Charles worked out the mean, median, and mode for each of the distributions, and indicated this on the histograms with black vertical markings. Unfortunately, Charles does not remember which marking is which. For each of the following graphics, indicate which of the three solid vertical markings corresponds to the mean, median, and mode, or describe why it is not possible to tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot only two markings are differentiable from one another: one in the bin immediately before \\(30\\) and one in the bin immediately before \\(40\\). We know that the mode of the distribution falls into the bin around \\(40\\), and so the two lines here indicate the mean and the median. With the plot we should expect that the mean is slightly higher than the median, since the tail extends ever so slightly beyond symmetry to the positive side.\nHere we can discern the mode to be marked around the \\(80\\) minute mark. The other two markings, for the mean and median, are marked in the bin just beyond \\(40\\). Here we know that the mean should be higher than the median, since the outlying spike later on will have the effect of pulling-up the observed mean, without impacting the median. Thus, we observe in order the median, mean, then mode.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also important to remember that, for each of these quantities, when computed on a dataset, we refer to them as sample measures. That is, we call the mode the sample mode, the median the sample median, and the mean the sample mean. This terminology emphasizes that our calculations are not with respect to a theoretical random variable with some assumed probability distribution, but rather from a sample of data that was actually observed. Recall that we view our sample as being realizations of a random quantity, either as a random process or from a larger population. That is, we can think of these measures as statistics computed on a sample, rather than the parameters that could be computed on the population.\n\n\n11.3.6 Measures of Spread or Variability\nWhen we introduced the concept of the expected value, and other measures of location of a random variable, we indicated that these would be insufficient to accurately summarize the behaviour of a random quantity. The same is true of a frequency distribution. Once again, by complementing the measures of central tendency with measures of spread, we are better able to understand the data which were actually observed, and use this to inform our understanding of the data. Combining variability, with central tendency, and distributional shape gives a good overall picture of what was observed, in a digestible summary form. The primary measures of variability for a dataset’s distribution are the same quantities used to measure variability of a random variable: the (sample) variance, (sample) IQR, and (sample) range.\n\nDefinition 11.11 (Sample Range) The sample range is the observed range in the data set. We define the sample range to be the difference between the maximum observed data point and the minimum observed data point. That is, if the ordered data is observed as \\[x_{(1)} \\leq x_{(2)} \\leq \\cdots \\leq x_{(n)},\\] then the sample range is \\[\\text{Range} = \\max\\{x\\} - \\min\\{x\\} = x_{(n)} - x_{(1)}.\\] Just as with the range of a random variable, the range may be reported as either the distance between the minimum and maximum, or else as the minimum and maximum points themselves.\n\nJust as with random variables, the sample range gives a rather coarse view of variability within a datset. The sample range does give information regarding the values that are possible, based on what was observed within the data, but it does not necessarily provide a reasonable representation of which values were commonly expressed throughout the data. A single outlying point can drramatically impact the range, without meaningfully changing the observed patterns. For this reason, we will often consider the sample IQR instead.\n\nDefinition 11.12 (Sample Interquartile Range (IQR)) The sample interquartile range is the difference between the first and third quartiles in the dataset. That is, it is the length that spans the middle \\(50\\%\\) of observations within the variable. The sample IQR is computed as \\(\\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1\\), where \\(Q3\\) and \\(Q1\\) are the third and first quartiles.\nIn order to compute \\(Q1\\) you compute the median of the first half of the data. In order to compute \\(Q3\\) you compute the median of the second half of the data. If there are an odd number of points, the central point is computed in both. That is, taking \\[x_{(1)} \\leq x_{(2)} \\leq \\cdots \\leq x_{(n)},\\] then for the first quartile, \\[Q1 = \\begin{cases}\\text{Median}\\{x_{(1)}, x_{(2)},\\dots, x_{(n/2)}\\} & n \\text{ even} \\\\ \\text{Median}\\{x_{(1)}, x_{(2)}, \\dots, x_{([n+1]/2)}\\} & n \\text{ odd}\\end{cases}.\\] The third quartile, \\(Q3\\), is computed similarly as \\[Q3 = \\begin{cases}\\text{Median}\\{x_{(n/2+1)}, x_{(n/2 + 2)},\\dots, x_{(n)}\\} & n \\text{ even} \\\\ \\text{Median}\\{x_{([n+1]/2)}, x_{([n+1]/2+1)}, \\dots, x_{(n)}\\} & n \\text{ odd}\\end{cases}.\\]\n\nThe interquartile range has the same benefits when compared to the range in a sample as it did for random variables. Outlying points that substantially deviate from the trends that are actually observed do not make a large difference on the sample IQR, where they will on the sample range. This can be desirable for understanding the variability in most of the data. Just as with random variables, the range and IQR are analogous in that they give a full representation of how spread out the data are. It is also possible to conceive of variability as how far from average data tend to be. For this, we consider the sample variance (and standard deviation).\n\nDefinition 11.13 (Sample Variance) The sample variance is an analogue to the population variance, measuring how far data are from the sample mean, on average. To compute the sample variance we take the following form \\[s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2.\\] Note that the division here is by \\(n-1\\) rather than by \\(n\\).14 Notice that if \\(n\\) is large, dividing by \\(n\\) or by \\(n-1\\) will give roughly the same results.\n\nThe sample variance has the same underlying concern as the variance of a random variable: namely, it is a squared quantity. As a result, we will often consider the sample standard deviation, which is given by the square root of the sample variance, as an alternative representation of the sample variability.\n\nDefinition 11.14 (Sample Standard Deviation) The sample standard deviation is an analogue to the population standard deviation, giving an approximate measure of the mean deviation from the sample mean, measured in the same units. The sample standard deviation is given by the square root of the sample variance, which is to say \\[\\text{SD} = s = \\sqrt{s^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}.\\]\n\nThese measures of spread are also useful to supplement the understanding of the behaviour of a dataset that is provided by the measures of central tendency. Specifically, by reporting measures of central tendency, alongside measures of spread, and a description of the shape of the distribution, you are able to describe and summarize the beahviour of a dataset in a concise manner in such a way so as to allow for a deep understanding of the patterns that have emerged.\n\nExample 11.10 (Sadie Questions the Spread in Bill Lengths) After having described the central tendency of the bill length data that Charles day dreamed about, Sadie inquires about the variability in the data. Charles, so focused on the penguins themselves, had not even stopped to consider how much variability may be present in these data. Sadie decides to help out by computing measures of sample variability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49.0\n37.8\n45.8\n39.0\n43.2\n48.8\n37.8\n49.1\n40.9\n37.3\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the sample range of these data?\nWhat is the sample IQR of these data?\nWhat is the sample variance of these data? What is the sample standard deviation?\nWhat is the variance of the bill lengths? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution is made easier by first ordering the data. Consider\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37.3\n37.8\n37.8\n39.0\n40.9\n43.2\n45.8\n48.8\n49.0\n49.1\n\n\n\n\nThe largest value is \\(49.1\\) and the smallest is \\(37.3\\). As a result the sample range is \\(49.1 - 37.3 = 11.8\\).\nTo find the sample IQR we find \\(Q1\\) and \\(Q3\\). There are \\(10\\) points, so \\(Q1\\) is the median of the first five, and \\(Q3\\) is the median of the last \\(5\\). The first five points are \\(37.3, 37.8, 37.8, 39.0, 40.9\\) so \\(Q1 = 37.8\\). The last \\(5\\) points are \\(43.2, 45.8,  48.8, 49.0, 49.1\\) so \\(Q3 =  48.8\\). Thus, the IQR is \\(48.8 - 37.8 = 11\\).\nFor the sample variance, we first note that (from Example 11.8), we know that \\(\\overline{X} = 42.87\\). Thus, we get \\[\\begin{align*}\ns^2 &= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\overline{x})^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{9}\\left((37.3 - 42.87)^2 + (37.8 - 42.87)^2 + (37.8-42.87)^2 + (39 - 42.87)^2\\right. \\\\\n&\\left.+ (40.9-42.87)^2 + (43.2-42.87)^2 + (45.8 - 42.87)^2 + (48.8 - 42.87)^2 + \\right.\\\\\n&\\left.(49 -42.87)^2 + (49.1 - 42.87)^2\\right) \\\\\n&= 24.6156\n\\end{align*}\\] For the sample standard deviation, we simply take the square root fo this, giving \\(s = \\sqrt{24.6156} = 4.9615\\).\nWe do not know, given this information, what the population variance will be. We do not have access to enough information to compute the parameter, and instead must rely on using only our sample statistics. These are measures of the data that are observed, rather than the full population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.7 The Five Number Summary and Boxplots\nHistograms display a substantial amount of information for the entire observed distribution. They display the shape of the distribution, as well as the details as to which observations are likely or unlikely values, allowing this to be seen in one place. This amount of detail is often very useful, but on occasion it can obscure the larger picture. This becomes particularly apparent when we wish to compare the distribution of two different variables, or perhaps the same variable across two or more categories. In these situations, the numeric summaries that we have discussed end up holding more weight. While it is very often to report the mean along with the standard deviation, as the two values complement eachother well, it is also very common to report the so-called five number summary of a data.\n\nDefinition 11.15 (Five Number Summary) The five number summary is a method for reporting a set of descriptive statistics for a set of observed data. The five number summary consists of five numbers, listed in order. This is given by \\[\\min(x), Q1, \\text{Median}(x), Q3, \\max(x).\\] That is, the five number summary reports the minimum, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value from a dataset. Doing so provides a succinct summary of both the location as well as the spread of observed data.\n\nFrom the five number summary we also immediately know the range, and the IQR. While it is useful to specifically report the values of the five number summary, it can be even more effectively to display this graphically. Boxplots are a graphical display which leverage this idea. For a variable, the boxplot displays the minimum, the maximum, the median, as well as the first and third quartiles \\(Q1\\) and \\(Q3\\), in ascending order, for a given variable. In order to do this, a box is drawn starting at \\(Q1\\) and going up to \\(Q3\\). Then, the median is marked in the middle of this box. Extending from the box are the whiskers.\nEach whisker is drawn out a length of \\(1.5\\) times the observed IQR, stopping at the highest (or lowest) point within that range. Thus, if all points fall within \\(1.5\\) times the IQR of either \\(Q1\\) or \\(Q3\\), then the whiskers will stop at the minimum or maximum point observed. If not, there are points beyond those included in the whiskers: these are typically referred to as outliers. The outliers are drawn beyond the whiskers of a boxplot, drawing a single dot for each point.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: A visual representation of a boxplot. The five number summary is included, along with an indication of which values fall outside of an expected range by using the whiskers to indicate \\(1.5\\) times the IQR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.11 (Boxplots and Numeric Summaries) Charles and Sadie have gotten very much into the summarizing data from the penguins. For the first sample of penguins, they have measurements of bill lengths in mm, with the following observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49.0\n37.8\n45.8\n39.0\n43.2\n48.8\n37.8\n49.1\n40.9\n37.3\n\n\n\nThey took another two samples with other bill length measurements, but seemed to have lost the data directly. Fortunately, they have the five number summaries. These are given by the following.\n\n\n\nSample\nMin\nQ1\nMedian\nQ3\nMax\n\n\n\n\n2\n32\n40\n43\n45\n52\n\n\n3\n34\n37\n41\n49\n50\n\n\n\n\nWrite down the five number summary for the first sample.\nSketch a boxplot for the first sample, or explain why it is not possible.\nSketch a boxplot for the second sample, or explain why it is not possible.\nSketch a boxplot for the third sample, or explain why it is not possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the previous examples, Example 11.8 and Example 11.10, we found that the five number summary would be given by \\(37.3, 37.8, 42.05, 48.8, 49.1\\).\nThe boxplot here will have a box drawn from \\(37.8\\) to \\(48.8\\), with a median line drawn at \\(42.05\\). The whiskers will extend for \\(37.3\\) which is only \\(0.5\\) beneath \\(Q1\\) and so there will be no outlier points drawn. The upper whisker will be drawn out to \\(49.1\\) which is only \\(0.3\\) above \\(Q3\\) and so it will be drawn without outlier points. This can be pictured as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case we will be unable to draw a boxplot for the sample. The issue is that the minimum point is \\(32\\) which is \\(8\\) below \\(Q1\\). The IQR is \\(45 - 40 = 5\\), and so \\(1.5\\times 5 = 7.5\\). As a result, the minimum would need to be drawn as an outlier point, which means that we cannot know where the whiskers will stop. This concern is not present on the upper side, where the whisker would be extended to \\(52\\).\nHere we can use the \\(5\\) number summary to draw the boxplot directly. The box would be drawn from \\(37\\) to \\(49\\), with the medina marked at \\(41\\). The whiskers would extend down to \\(34\\) (\\(3\\) below \\(Q1\\)) and up to \\(50\\) (\\(1\\) above \\(Q3\\)). This can be pictured as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the boxplot is inspired by the five number summary, but it encodes slightly more information. It will be precisely the same whenever the maximum and minimum fall within \\(1.5\\) times the IQR of the first and third quartiles, but it will include further information in all other cases. This is done to indicate points which are outliers, those which appear to deviate from expected trends (of nicely behaved data).15\nTypically, the boxplots will be drawn so that multiple plots are shown on the same graph. In order to read a boxplot you can compare the medians, and then the spread. The typical variability of the quantity is contained within the box portion, and plots which have largely overlapping boxes are often thought to behave similarly. The whiskers represent the outer limits of what is expected within the data: if both whiskers are roughly the same length, the distribution appears to be mostly symmetric. If one is longer than the other, the distribution exhibits either positive or negative skew. The outliers can contribute to the illustration of skewness on the distribution, but are typically less representative of the distribution itself. A boxplot with a lot of outliers is suggestive of a dataset with far heavier tails than is typical for most well-behaved data, and any analysis on these data should proceed cautiously.\n\nExample 11.12 (Penguin Species Comparisons) The enthusiasm that Charles and Sadie had for the penguin data lead them to reaching out to some researchers who have actually studied the penguins. The researchers, grateful to share their work with enthusiastic individuals, sent a series of boxplots comparing multiple different measurements broken up by penguing species and by the sex of the penguins. Charles and Sadie begin to study these various boxplots, comparing the distributions illustrated by each of the boxplots, and trying to determine differences in observations. For each of the following boxplots, compare the location and spread of the various distributions represented, and briefly describe what is observed. The following boxplots are given for:\n\nBill length by species.\nBill depth by species.\nFlipper length by sex.\nBody mass by sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy way of comparison, the adelie pegnuins appear to have less long bills than both the chinstrap and the gentoos, even when accounting for variability. We can see this since the median is substantially lower, and the box does not appear to overlap at all. The chinstrap and gentoo have more comparable bill length,s with the chinstrap being slightly larger in general, but with the gentoo having extreme observations that are the longest observed.\nThe adelie have a median of just below \\(40\\), will an interquartile range from about \\(37\\) to around \\(41\\), and all observations falling between about \\(32\\) and \\(46\\). The chinstrap have a median length around \\(50\\), with an interquartile range from about \\(46\\) through \\(51\\), and a full data span between about \\(41\\) and \\(58\\). The gentoo have a median of around \\(47\\), with a fairly small IQR, spanning from around \\(46\\) to around \\(50\\). There are no negative outliers, all points falling above about \\(41\\), but the highest point extends to nearly \\(60\\), sitting beyond the outlier limit of around \\(56\\).\nThe specific five number summary (not easily read directly from the boxplots are):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelie\nChinstrap\nGentoo\n\n\n\n\nMin\n32.10\n40.90\n40.90\n\n\nQ1\n36.75\n46.30\n45.30\n\n\nMedian\n38.80\n49.55\n47.30\n\n\nQ3\n40.75\n51.15\n49.55\n\n\nMax\n46.00\n58.00\n59.60\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe adelie an chinstrap penguins exhibit roughly the same location, with the chinstrap exhibiting slightly more variability in terms of IQR and slightly less variability in terms of the overall range. The gentoo have less deep bills than either of the other species, with very little overlap between them at all.\nThe adlie have a median depth of around \\(18.5\\), with an IQR ranging from just under \\(18\\) to around \\(19\\). There is one outlying observation, sitting above \\(21\\), with no outliers in the negative direction. The smallest observed bill depth is around \\(15.5\\). The chinstrap have a similar median, again around \\(18.5\\), with an IQR spanning from just below \\(18\\) to just over \\(19\\). The range of the data, however, sit from around \\(16.5\\) through to approxiamtely \\(21\\), with no extreme outlying observations. The gentoo have a median that is a little ways above \\(15\\), with an IQR from just above \\(14\\) to around \\(16\\). The range of the data in total is from around \\(13\\) to around \\(17\\).\nThe specific five number summary (not easily read directly from the boxplots are):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelie\nChinstrap\nGentoo\n\n\n\n\nMin\n15.5\n16.40\n13.1\n\n\nQ1\n17.5\n17.50\n14.2\n\n\nMedian\n18.4\n18.45\n15.0\n\n\nQ3\n19.0\n19.40\n15.7\n\n\nMax\n21.5\n20.80\n17.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMale penguins have slightly longer flippers, on average, but with fairly substantial overlap. Both males and females tend to exhibit similar spread, both in terms of the IQR and the range of the data, and the it quite a lot of overlap for both. For each species, the median sits closer to the first quartile than the third quartile, which suggests that there is likely some skewness in the positive direction, at least throughout the bulk of theo bservations.\nTo summarize each distribution, you should be able to determine the approximate locations of each of the five numbers from the summary. There are no outliers for any of the measurements. The specific five number summary (not easily read with specificity from the boxplots are):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale\nMale\n\n\n\n\nMin\n172\n178.0\n\n\nQ1\n187\n193.0\n\n\nMedian\n193\n200.5\n\n\nQ3\n210\n219.0\n\n\nMax\n222\n231.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMale penguins weigh more on average than the females. The male penguins also seem to exhibit a wider spread, both in terms of the IQR and the overall range. There is a substantial amount of overlap between the main data, however, less so than for flipper length. Just as with flipper length, the median sits closer to the first quartile than the third, suggesting that there is a slight positive skew in the data.\nTo summarize each distribution, you should be able to determine the approximate locations of each of the five numbers from the summary. There are no outliers for any of the measurements.

    "text": "12.1 The Goal, and Fundamental Dilemma, of Statistics\nRecall that the goal of statistics, at the most basic of levels, is to draw conclusions regarding the parameter values in a population of interest by analyzing a sample and computing statistics. Revisit Figure 10.1 for a visual representation of this procedure. In Chapter 11 we discussed in depth the study of descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics aim to describe the data that have been observed through the study, through the computation of sample statistics or similar graphical procedures. That is, using the techniques from descriptive statistics we can take a sample and derive statistics from it. The fundamental dilemma we are faced with, however, is that a statistic will not typically equal a parameter value exactly. That is, the value we compute using a sample for any property1 will not equal the value that the same property would take on in the population. As a result, while descriptive statistics allow us to understand thoroughly the data that we have collected, they do not (alone) address the complete goal of statistics.\nTo compliment descriptive statistics we wish to be able to make statements about how sample statistics relate to, or are connected to, parameter values. In order to do so it is worth asking why do the values of statistics tend to differ from the values of the corresponding parameters. Intuitively, the issue we are faced with is that a sample does not include every element of the population. As a result, quantities computed on a sample will differ from the same quantities computed in the population owing to the different make-up of the sample. We could envision what would happen if we took a second, different sample from the same population. We would likely get different elements in the sample, and as a result, anything computed on the sample would differ from the first time. If we continued to take samples, compute the values, and compare them we would find that each sample is subtly different from every other, leading to the values of statistics moving around sample-to-sample. Of course, if we could access the full population, the value of the parameter would never change since there is only one, true value. These differences sample-to-sample are referred to as sampling variability, and explains the core reason why statistics and parameters differ from one another.\nTo understand this procedure completely, consider the following population of squares, depicted visually. If we had access to this entire population we would be able to determine any parameter value that we would like to know about, for instance, understanding the proportion of black squares present (in the population this results in a proportion of 0.195).\nFigure 12.1: The population of squares. Consider each colour to represent a trait or variable for each individual in the population.\nGenerally, we will be unable to observe an entire population, and instead would be required to take random samples. If we take samples of size \\(10\\) from the population we may end up with something like the following.\nFigure 12.2: A single sample from the population. In this sample of size \\(10\\), \\(2\\) of the resulting squares are black, making the sample proportion \\(0.2\\).\nThis sample, however, was not the only sample that we could have seen. Consider the following \\(16\\) samples. In each of them the number of black squares (and thus the proportion of black squares) differs. These differences arise naturally based on which squares happened to be included in the sample, and those that happened to be ignored. If we continued to sample more and more from the population and work out the corresponding proportion of black squares observed, we would see the proportions continue to vary.\nFigure 12.3: Sixteen samples from the population. Each sample exhibits a different proportion of squares which are black, and as a result, a different sample proportion. Because this proportion differs from sample-to-sample we say that it is subject to sampling variability.\nOwing to sampling variability, every time that we take a sample we expect to get a different value for our statistic. Because of this we can often regard the value of the statistic as being random. Ultimately, if the members of our sample determine the value of our statistic, and the members of our sample are randomly selected, then we know that the value of our statistic is a random value. Any numeric quantity which takes on random values is referred to as a random variable (Definition 5.1) and as a result statistics are random variables. Because statistics are random variables we must also conclude that statistics have distributions. The distribution of a statistic is referred to as the sampling distribution for the statistic, and serves as the primary tool for understanding how well the values of statistics and parameters agree with one another.",

    "text": "Definition 12.1 (Sampling Variability) Sampling variability refers to the variation that occurs between samples drawn from the same population (whether the same method for selection is used or not). This variability manifests itself in the values of statistics that are computed on a sample, where repeated sampling from the same population will result in different values for the statistics. This variability is inherent in the sampling process and emerges owing to the fact that each sample will consist of different elements from the same population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.1 (Sadie, Charles, and Ketchup) Sadie and Charles get along quite well in most regards, however, they cannot agree at all on ketchup. Specifically, Charles finds ketchup to be repugnant, disliking even being in its presence. Sadie, on the other hand, finds it to be quite pleasant and will happily enjoy it alongside many dishes. This is a frequent point of contention for them. As a result, they decide that they should take a survey of the individuals at their favourite coffee shop to settle the debate once-and-for-all. Thus, they go around asking each individual their thoughts on ketchup.\n\nIn the population as a whole, the number of people who like ketchup is best described by what distribution? What is the parameter of interest for Charles and Sadie?\nIf it is found that more people in the coffee shop agree with Charles than with Sadie, does that mean that more people in the population dislike ketchup? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population distribution should be approximately binomial. The relevant parameter will be \\(p\\), the probability of “success”. Here \\(p\\) can either represent the proportion of individuals who like (or dislike) ketchup, depending on the ways in which the questions were phrased.\nNo, not necessarily. Because of sampling variability, it is possible to have selected a sample that shows a much different proportion than the true proportion in the population. It may be the case that it is close, or that it is far off. However, the general procedure of computing a statistic on a population is random and as such, the variation needs to be accounted for when drawing conclusions.",

    "section": "12.2 Sampling Distributions",
    "text": "12.2 Sampling Distributions\n\nDefinition 12.2 (Sampling Distribution) A sampling distribution is the distribution of a sample statistic. The sampling distribution arises due to sampling variability, rendering samples – and statistics computed using samples – random.\n\nThe fact that statistics are random variables is the critical realization that facilitates inferential statistics. However, this is a concept which is not always immediately clear. It is worth reemphasizing how sampling distributions emerge, and how they differ from both frequency (or data) distributions, and from the underlying population distributions. We first consider a population. In this population the trait of interest will differ between individuals, and these differences will be summarized by a relevant parameter. When populations are large2 we can view the trait in the population as being randomly distributed. We are thinking that, if we were to observe a single individual from the population, their value of the trait would follow some distribution. We call this underlying distribution the population distribution. Our interest is ultimately in the population distribution.\nWe can then think of taking a random, finite sample from the population. We can measure the value of the trait for all individuals in the sample. These observations constitute an observable dataset. Within these data we can discuss the frequency distribution or the data distribution, which summarizes how often values of the trait occurred in the sample. The data distribution describes what we actually observed, and we can characterize it exactly. We hope that our sample was a good sample3 and as a result, we hope that the data distribution is similar to the population distribution. However, we do not expect that these distributions will coincide directly since our sample is a subset of the population, meaning many values have been excluded. Using this sample we are able to compute statistics that are the sample version of the parameters of interest. These statistics characterize the data distribution in a similar way to the parameters characterize the population distribution.\nWe can then imagine repeating this process of sampling many times. Each time we do we would receive a slightly different sample, which in turn produces a slightly different data distribution, and as a result a slightly different statistic value. Suppose that we recorded the value of the statistic each time that we took our sample, and then re-sampled again. Doing this over and over again would produce a set of values for the statistics. These values would be seen as specific realizations from the distribution of possible realizations of the sample. This distribution is the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution characterizes the random variability in the value of a sample statistic, were we able to repeatedly compute this over many different samples. The more spread that is in the sampling distribution, the more we expect different samples to differ from one another in terms of the value of the relevant statistic.\nConsider the previous example of sampling squares from the population in Figure 12.1. If we continued to do this over, and over again, and we recorded the proportion of squares that were black, the resulting distribution would the sampling distribution of the proportion of black squares. Looking at this distribution we could then ask “given a single sample from the population, how likely are we to get a representative value for the sample proportion?” If this probability is high then we can be relatively confident that a sample will provide us with a useful guess to the true parameter value. If this probability is low, we cannot be sure that we are learning much from the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: The sampling distribution for the proportion of black squares in samples of size \\(10\\) from the population of coloured squares. This distribution can be thought to emerge from the process of repeatedly sampling from the population, computing the resulting statistic, and then recording those statistics into a dataset itself. Moreover, we can read the probabilities here as stating “the probability that the proportion of black squares in a sample of size \\(10\\) will take on \\(x\\) is \\(y\\).”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the sampling distribution of a statistic were known exactly, then probabilities could be computed regarding that statistic in the same way as probabilities are computed for any random variable. In our example, for instance, if we took \\(\\rho\\) to represent the sample proportion for a random sample of size \\(10\\), then we could claim that \\[P(\\rho = 0.2) \\approx 0.3056561.\\] Because we know the value of the population parameter, and because \\(0.2\\) is as close to \\(0.195\\) as a sample can get in a population of size \\(10\\), we can thus say that nearly \\(31\\%\\) of samples will provide an estimate that is as close to the truth as is possible, given the sample size. If we instead consider \\[P(0.1 \\leq \\rho \\leq 0.3) \\approx 0.7792981,\\] and so nearly \\(78\\%\\) of our samples should be within \\(1\\) of the closest sample value to the true population parameter. That is, we can use the sampling distribution to assess how reliable our statistic is as a proxy for the parameter value.\nA major difficulty in the application of this procedure in practice is that typically we do not have the true population on hand to either directly compute the sampling distribution, or to know what the true parameter value should be. If we did have access to the full population we would not need to use samples in the first place. Despite these limitations, the sampling distribution is still the key tool in unlocking an assessment of reliability of statistics as proxies for parameters. By recognizing that the sampling distribution is inherently useful in explaining the random behaviour of statistics, all that remains is being able to connect the sampling distribution to the population distribution. Fortunately, we will often find that, even without knowing the specific sampling distribution, we can make definitive statements about the link between the sampling distribution and the population distribution, giving a bridge between statistics and the corresponding parameters.\n\nExample 12.2 (Sadie, Charles, and Ketchup (Repeated Over and Over)) After recognizing the lack of scientific validity of their single sample, Charles and Sadie decide that they should repeat their survey many times over. Each time they gather a sample of individuals and ask whether they agree with Charles or Sadie more. They do this many, many times, and report the proportion of individuals who agree with Sadie in the following chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is this graph related to the data distribution? The population distribution? The sampling distribution?\nAccording to this graph, what is (approximately) the probability that in a sample they will find more people agreeing with Sadie?\nWhat conclusions can be drawn?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the sampling distribution of the proportion of individuals who like ketchup in samples at random from the population. The population distribution would be binary, with everyone being either a \\(1\\) or a \\(0\\), however, the proportion in the \\(0\\) category should be related to the proportions realized in this graphic (so, around a 50-50 split). The data distribution would be comprised of observations from a single sample, where individuals in that sample were split at \\(1\\) and \\(0\\) as well. These observations would give rise to a single proportion displayed here.\nAccording to the graph it appears that the data are split roughly 50-50 with proportions above and below \\(0.5\\). That is, it seems about equally likely that in a sample of individuals more people agree with Charles or more people agree with Sadie.\nWhile drawing any definitive conclusions here is challenging from the graphic alone, owing to sampling variability, it seems likely that we could suggest that there is not a strong preference one way or the other in the population. If there were we would expect that more proportions would end up falling in favour of either Charles or Sadie, rather than the equal split that we actually observe.",

    "text": "12.3 The Sampling Distribution of a Sample Mean\nAs an illustrative example demonstrating the connection between the sampling distribution and the population distribution we will consider the case of sample means. Note that sample means are among the most important statistics that are worked with and so this example is representative of a large quantity of statistics in practical use. Moreover, statistics like sample proportions can be thought of as the sample mean of binary data.4 Other statistics can be analyzed in a similar manner, allowing us to draw similar conclusions for other parameters of interest.\n\n12.3.1 Characterizing the Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean\nConsider an arbitrary population distribution for some trait. Suppose that \\(X\\) is a random variable that is drawn from this population distribution, so that the mean in the population is \\(E[X]\\) and the variance in the population is \\(\\text{var}(X)\\). We will typically denote \\(E[X] = \\mu\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X) = \\sigma^2\\), as we did for normal populations. Now, if we consider drawing a sample of size \\(n\\) from this population, and if we suppose that these are drawn independently of one another, then our sample can be thought of as a collection of \\(n\\) independent and identically distributed (Definition 5.12) random variables, denoted \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\). Each of these random variables will have mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), and each is independent of all the others. Then, the sample mean of this hypothetical sample is given by \\[\\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i.\\] Note that we are using the same notation we used for random variables where capital letters indicate a random quantity, and the corresponding lowercase letters represent a specific value. Thus, \\(\\overline{X}\\) is thought of as a random variable which represents the sample mean for a random sample. If we actually take a sample and compute the mean, we would have a corresponding \\(\\overline{x}\\), which is just one realization of the random variable \\(\\overline{X}\\).\nSince \\(\\overline{X}\\) is random it has a distribution. Because it is a statistic, its distribution is a sampling distribution, and in particular it is the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The specific form of this distribution will not generally be known, however, we can ask questions regarding parameters of this distribution (that is, sampling distribution parameters). Specifically, we may ask ourselves whether it is possible to determine \\(E[\\overline{X}]\\) and \\(\\text{var}(\\overline{X})\\). Note that these are not the same as \\(E[X]\\) and \\(\\text{var}(X)\\), where the former are the parameters of the sampling distribution and the latter are the parameters of the population distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mean and Variance for the Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean\n\n\n\nUsing the properties of expectation and variance of independent and identically distributed samples discussed in Section 7.5, we can claim that no matter the population distribution, \\[E[\\overline{X}] = \\mu \\quad\\text{ and }\\quad \\text{var}(\\overline{X}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}.\\] That is, the mean and variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean correspond to the mean of the population distribution and the variance of the population distribution scaled by the sample size, respectively.\n\n\nPractically this means that the sample mean is centered on the true population mean, and on average should be correct. Moreover, the variance of the sample mean is related to the variance in the population5 and is inversely related to the sample size. The relationship to the sample size gives a mathematical justification for the intuition that “larger samples are preferable.” It makes sense that if your sample size is larger, you will get a better estimate of the truth. This can be justified since, as the sample size grows, the variance of the sampling distribution shrinks, and the sampling distribution becomes more heavily concentrated around the true population mean. It is constructive to consider what happens to the variability in the sampling distribution as the sample size increases \\(n\\to\\infty\\).\nSpecifically, as the sample size grows more and more, the variance shrinks smaller and smaller. Eventually, in the limit, the variance will shrink all the way to \\(0\\). At this point, we will be left with a sample mean that is exactly equal to the population mean, since \\(E[X] = E[\\overline{X}]\\) and the variance of \\(\\overline{X}\\) is zero. Of course, if we could take an infinite sample we would have taken every member of the population into the sample, and so we should expect that the two align in that case. Now, it will never be the case that we have a truly infinite sample, and so there will always be some variability that remains in the sampling distribution. However, the reduction in variance occurs even at finite samples. As more and more members are included in the sample, there is less and less variability in the statistic, and the results become more and more concentrated around the true population value. The important point of this characterization is that it does not matter what the population distribution is, nor what the value for the sample mean is.\nMore often than not when discussing the variability of the sampling distribution the measure of choice will be the standard deviation rather than the variance. That is, instead of reporting that \\(\\text{var}(\\overline{X}) = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\), it is far more common to report that \\(\\text{SD}(\\overline{X}) = \\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). These two quantities hold the same information, and it is straightforward to move from one to the other by either taking the square root or squaring the quantity. Now, when the standard deviation is computed for a statistic, such as the sample mean, it is not typically referred to as a standard deviation. Instead, it is called a standard error.\n\nDefinition 12.3 (Standard Error (of a statistic)) For any statistic \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) the standard error of the statistic is given by its standard deviation. That is, \\[\\text{SE}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = \\text{SD}(\\widehat{\\theta}).\\]\n\n\nDefinition 12.4 (Standard Error (of the Sample Mean)) The standard error of the sample mean (SEM) is the standard error of \\(\\overline{X}\\). For a population with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), this is given by \\[\\text{SE}(\\overline{X}) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\]\n\nThe standard error is a useful metric since, if reported alongside the estimate, we can directly quantify the uncertainty of the statistic. A higher standard error equates directly to more uncertainty in the statistic and this uncertainty is measured on the same scale as the statistic itself. Now, in practice, you will not have an exact value for the standard error since it relies on knowledge of \\(\\sigma\\). Still, it will often be the case that we can get a good sense as to the standard error via the sample standard deviation, and use this quantity in place.6\n\nExample 12.3 (Charles and Sadie Visit the Zoo) One day Charles and Sadie decide to visit the local zoo (a zoo with a strong focus on conservation research). Charles and Sadie learn that:\n\nEastern lowland gorillas weigh on average around \\(407\\)lbs, with a standard deviation of approximately \\(65\\)lbs.\nSumatran elephants weigh on average around \\(6600\\)lbs, with a standard deviation of approximately \\(750\\)lbs.\nLeatherback sea turtles weigh on average around \\(1036\\)lbs, with a standard deviation of approximately \\(125\\)lbs.\n\nCharles and Sadie think about finding samples of \\(16\\) of each of these species in the wild.\n\nCharacterize the sampling distribution for each of the species.\nIf larger samples were taken, how would this change the mean and standard error of the sampling distributions?\nSuppose a sample of size \\(n\\) is taken of leatherback turtles. How large of a sample of Sumatran elephants would be needed to have the same standard error of the sample mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the gorillas, the sampling distribution will be characterized by a mean of \\(407\\) and a variance of \\(\\dfrac{65^2}{16} = 264.0625\\). The standard error is given by \\(\\dfrac{65}{\\sqrt{16}} = 16.25\\). For the elephants, the sampling distribution’s mean will be \\(6600\\) with a variance of \\(35156.25\\) and a standard error of \\(187.5\\). Finally, the sea turtles will have a sampling distribution characterized by a mean of \\(1036\\) with a variance of \\(976.5625\\) and a standard error of \\(31.25\\).\nNo matter the sample size, the mean of the sampling distribution does not change. As the sample size increases, however, the standard error will decrease. As a result, we would expect less variability in the sampling distribution with larger samples compared to the sampling distribution with smaller samples.\nSuppose \\(n_2\\) elephants are sampled. The standard errors are given by \\(\\dfrac{125}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) and \\(\\dfrac{750}{\\sqrt{n_2}}\\), respectively. Thus, we get \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{125}{\\sqrt{n}} &= \\frac{750}{\\sqrt{n_2}} \\\\\n\\sqrt{n_2} &= 6\\sqrt{n} \\\\\nn_2 &= 36n.\n\\end{align*}\\] As a result, you would need to sample \\(36\\) times as many elephants as you did turtles to have the same standard error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChebyshev’s Inequality and Bounds on the Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that the population variance is known but that the population mean is unknown. Moreover, the population distribution is unknown. In this case, we can still apply Chebyshev’s inequality to make probability statements regarding the likelihood that \\(\\overline{X}\\) is close to \\(\\mu\\). Recall that Chebyshev’s inequality states that, for a random variable \\(X\\) with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), \\[P(\\mu - k\\sigma \\leq X \\leq \\mu + k\\sigma) \\geq 1 - \\frac{1}{k^2}.\\] Suppose then that we consider the sample mean, \\(\\overline{X}\\) to be the random variable of interest. The standard deviation of \\(\\overline{X}\\) is \\(\\text{SE}(\\overline{X}) = \\sigma/\\sqrt{n}\\). Then, if we take \\(\\delta\\) to be some positive value, we can state that the probability that \\(\\overline{X}\\) is within \\(\\delta\\) of \\(\\mu\\) is at least, \\[P(\\mu - \\delta \\leq \\overline{X} \\leq \\mu + \\delta) \\geq 1 - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\delta^2n^2}.\\] This will hold for any positive value of \\(\\delta\\).\nIf we take \\(\\delta = 2\\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\), for instance, then we will find that the probability that the sample mean is within two standard errors of the true population mean is at least \\(0.75\\). That is, no matter the distribution of the population, there is always at least a \\(0.75\\) chance that the sample mean will be within two standard errors of the truth. This gives further justification for reporting the standard error.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3.2 The Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean in Normal Populations\nWhile it is possible to make concrete statements regarding the relationship between the parameters of the sampling distribution and the population distribution, we are not able to make concrete probability statements regarding the sample mean in general.7 However, in certain cases we are able to make stronger statements regarding the sampling distribution. These statements stem from knowledge that we may have of the underlying population. While it may be unrealistic to make strong assumptions regarding the values of population parameters, it is often the case that we may have a general idea of the shape of the underlying distribution. In Chapter 8 and in Chapter 9 we discussed how certain named distributions emerge as a result of the underlying processes, and how these can be identified based on the particulars of a given scenario. If you are in a case where you are willing to make an assumption regarding the shape of the population distribution, it may be possible to make stronger statements regarding the sampling distribution.\nThe most common assumption to make regarding an underlying population distribution is that the population is (approximately) normally distributed. That is, we assume that \\(X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), where we perhaps have no knowledge as to what the values of \\(\\mu\\) or \\(\\sigma^2\\) are. Making this assumption regarding the shape of the distribution allows us to fully characterize the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\). To do so, we need only revisit the closure properties of the normal distribution. Specifically, if we have multiple quantities which are independent of one another, and each of them follows a normal distribution, then the sum of these random quantities will also follow a normal distribution. In addition, if we have a normally distributed random variable, and we multiply it by a constant, then the result will still be a normally distributed random variable.\nThe sample mean is constructed by first taking a sum of a set of random variables, and then second multiplying this summation by \\(\\dfrac{1}{n}\\). If the population is normally distributed then this is the sum of a set of normally distributed random variables, and as a result, will be normally distributed itself. That is, whenever the population distribution is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will also be normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean in Normal Populations\n\n\n\nSuppose that a population is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Then, supposing a random sample is taken independently, giving \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\), the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be such that \\[\\overline{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}).\\]\n\n\nIn these cases, it is possible to make more concrete statements regarding the behaviour of the sample mean. For instance, an application of the empirical rule tells us that in approximately \\(95\\%\\) of cases, the sample mean will be within two standard errors of the true mean. Supposing that the population variance is not too large, or the sample size is sufficiently large, this gives reasonable certainty that the sample mean is a good proxy for the population mean. Using this result to make definitive probability statements still requires knowledge of \\(\\sigma^2\\) in the population, which will often be an unrealistic assumption. In the coming chapters we will learn how to overcome this shortcoming and quantify the uncertainty in the values of statistics even without direct knowledge of the population variance. A more pressing question, however, is whether there are any strong statements that can be made about the distribution of the sample mean when the population is not normally distributed.\n\nExample 12.4 (Charles and Sadie Consider their Zoo Trip) After returning from the zoo, Charles and Sadie wish to figure out whether the zoo appeared to have a good representation of the animals or not. They record all of the following information:\n\nEastern lowland gorillas weigh on average around \\(407\\)lbs, with a standard deviation of approximately \\(65\\)lbs. The zoo had \\(4\\) gorillas with an average weight of \\(342\\)lbs.\nSumatran elephants weigh on average around \\(6600\\)lbs, with a standard deviation of approximately \\(750\\)lbs. The zoo had \\(25\\) elephants with an average weight of \\(6750\\)lbs.\nLeatherback sea turtles weigh on average around \\(1036\\)lbs, with a standard deviation of approximately \\(125\\)lbs. The zoo had \\(64\\) turtles, with an average weight of \\(1030\\)lbs.\n\nIn order to proceed, Charles and Sadie are willing to assume that the animals all have weights that are approximately normally distributed in the population.\n\nDescribe the sampling distributions for each animal from the zoo.\nIf the sample of gorillas is randomly selected from the wild, what is the probability that the zoo would have a sample weight as low (or lower) as what they have?\nIf the sample of elephants is randomly selected from the wild, what is the probability that the zoo would have a sample weight as high (or higher) as what they have?\nIf the sample of turtles is randomly selected from the wild, what is the probability that the zoo would have a sample weight between \\(1020.375\\) and \\(1051.625\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the populations are normally distributed all of the sampling distributions will be normally distributed as well. Let \\(G\\), \\(E\\), and \\(T\\) represent the random variables corresponding to gorillas, elephants, and turtles respectively. Then \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{G} &\\sim N\\left(407, \\frac{4225}{4}\\right)  \\\\\n\\overline{E} &\\sim N\\left(6600, \\frac{562500}{25}\\right) =  N\\left(6600, 22500\\right)\\\\\n\\overline{T} &\\sim N\\left(1036, \\frac{15625}{64}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSince the sampling distribution is normal we can compute this as \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(\\overline{G} \\leq 342) &= P(\\frac{\\overline{G} - 407}{\\sqrt{4225/4}} \\leq \\frac{342 - 407}{\\sqrt{4225/4}}) \\\\\n&= \\Phi\\left(-2\\right) \\\\\n&\\approx 0.025.\n\\end{align*}\\] The final approximation stems from an application of the empirical rule.\nAs above, we can take \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(\\overline{E} \\geq 6750) &= 1 - P(\\overline{E} \\leq 6750) \\\\\n&= 1 - P(\\frac{\\overline{E} - 6600}{\\sqrt{22500}} \\leq \\frac{6750 - 6600}{\\sqrt{22500}}) \\\\\n&= 1 - \\Phi(1) \\\\\n&\\approx 0.16.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFor the turtles we get \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(1020.375 \\leq \\overline{T} \\leq 1051.625) &= P(\\frac{1020.375 - 1036}{\\sqrt{15625/64}} \\leq \\frac{\\overline{T} - 1036}{\\sqrt{15625/64}} \\leq \\frac{1051.625 - 1036}{\\sqrt{15625/64}}) \\\\\n&= \\Phi(1) - \\Phi(-1) \\\\\n&\\approx 0.68.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3 The Central Limit Theorem\nIf the underlying population does not follow a normal distribution it will not be the case that the sampling distribution is exactly normally distributed. However, a remarkable result states that, while we cannot state that a normal distribution will be exactly correct for the sampling distribution, we can state that, in large enough samples, the normal distribution will be approximately correct for the sampling distribution. That is to say, no matter the population distribution, if the sample size is large enough, the sample mean will have a distribution that is approximately normal. This statement is known as the Central Limit Theorem, and it sits at the heart of many of the results we will leverage for inferential statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(X\\) is drawn from a population with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), but an otherwise unspecified distribution. If a sample of size \\(n\\) is drawn from this population, giving \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\), then supposing that \\(n\\) is large enough, we will have that \\[\\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\dot\\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}),\\] where \\(\\dot\\sim\\) means “is approximately distributed as”. More formally, we can state that as \\(n\\to\\infty\\), the distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) converges to a normal distribution.\n\n\nThe power of this result is difficult to overstate. Simply put, if \\(n\\) is sufficiently large then we do not need to know anything about the underlying population distribution in order to make use of the results from the normal distribution in assessing its behaviour. No matter the underlying population we can calculate using normal probabilities, make use of the empirical rule, and make definitive statements like those in the previous section. Importantly, these probabilities will not be exactly correct, however, even for moderate large \\(n\\), they will likely be close enough to be very useful. A natural question regarding the application of the Central Limit Theorem is then how large does \\(n\\) have to be? The short answer is that it depends. The required sample size for \\(n\\) depends primarily on how close to normality the original population is. If you have a population that is approximately normal to begin, even very small sample sizes will suffice for approximate normality. If the original population is further from normality then it will take larger samples to apply the CLT.\n\n\n\n\nThis plots shows the convergence of the sampling distribution of the sample mean to the normal distribution for three different populations. In the top row the population distribution is shown, followed by the sampling distribution for the sample mean over increasing values of \\(n\\). While all three end up following a normal distribution, and all three end-up having very little variance as the sample size grows (the \\(x\\)-axis are held constant across all plots), we can see that normality emerges more quickly for the populations that are closer to normality to begin.\n\n\n\n\n\nOften, the concrete advice will be that, if \\(n \\geq 30\\), the CLT will apply. As with most hard-and-fast rules, I would advise against following this dogmatically. The issue is two-fold. First, if populations are near to normality then the CLT will likely provide a suitable approximation for much smaller \\(n\\) than \\(30\\). Second, and more concerning, if the initial population is sufficiently far from normality it may require substantially larger sample sizes for the sampling distribution to appear normal. Instead of using a definitive, arbitrary cutoff, it is more sensible to consider the problem at hand, the likely shape of the population, and the sensitivity of your conclusions to the assumption that the CLT Is a good approximation. While it is hard to establish a clear-cut rule, it is always the case that as \\(n\\) increases in size the approximation becomes more and more reasonable. Throughout these course notes we will endeavour to make clear whenever the sample size is “large enough” for the CLT to hold. When in doubt, taking \\(n\\geq 30\\) provides a useful starting point.\n\nExample 12.5 (Charles and Sadie Re-Consider their Zoo Trip) After working out the probabilities associated with their zoo trip and the likelihood of observing what they observed (Example 12.4), Charles and Sadie do some additional research. They learn that their assumptions around the normally distributed weights of the animals likely does not hold. Instead, they learn that\n\nThe weights of gorillas are far from normal, with different modes emerging depending on various factors around the gorilla. The zoo had a sample of size \\(4\\).\nThe weights of elephants are close to normal, but not exactly so – there is more variability than would be expected in a normal population. The zoo had a sample of size \\(25\\).\nThe weights of sea turtles are far from normal, exhibiting skewness and multi-modality. The zoo had a sample of size \\(64\\).\n\n\nWhich of the conclusions that Charles and Sadie have previously drawn are still justified? Why and how?\nWhich of the conclusions that Charles and Sadie have previously drawn are no longer justified? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcluding that the sampling distribution for the sample mean weight of elephants is normally distributed is likely still justifiable. This is because the sample size (\\(25\\)) is likely large enough to invoke the CLT, meaning that the sampling distribution will be approximately normally distributed. This is justifiable since the population is approximately normal. Concluding that the sampling distribution for the sample mean weight of sea turtles is approximately normal is also likely justifiable. This is because, despite the fact that the population distribution is far from normal, the sample is large enough (\\(64\\)) to invoke the CLT. The distributions here will not be exactly normal, however, they will be close enough to use it as an approximation.\nConcluding that the sampling distribution for the sample mean weight of the gorillas is normal is no longer justified. Because the sample size is very small (\\(4\\)) we cannot use the CLT. As a result, we would rely on the population distribution being normal in order to use normal probabilities; however, in this case, the population is far from normal, invalidating the assumption.",

    "text": "12.4 Exploring Sampling Distributions in R\nThe fact that the sampling distribution is best interpreted as the distribution that arises from repeatedly computing a particular statistic renders statistical programming to be an effective tool for exploring the ideas associated with sampling variability and sample statistics. If the population distribution is known, then it is possible to (using the previously discussed tools for drawing samples from named distributions) to work out empirically the sampling distribution for any statistic. Moreover, we can use R to determine the necessary sample sizes in order for the sampling distribution of the sample mean to appear approximately normal. The process in all of these cases is similar: we repeatedly sample from the population distribution, compute the estimated statistic, and then record this value. Then, we can plot the sampling distribution by plotting the result of the various estimates.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe results of this first experiment demonstrate that, if the population is exponentially distributed, a sample of size \\(10\\) is insufficient to approximate normality. Consider what happens as you increase the sample size to the shape of the histogram. We can also see that the approximated mean and variance are close to what we would theoretically expect them to be, namely \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{160}\\). If the number of replicates were increased, these values should become closer to the truth.\nPerhaps more useful than considering the sampling distribution of the sample mean, however, is the use of statistical software to consider the sampling distributions of other statistics. Try to determine how you may modify this code to look at the sampling distribution for the sample variance, or the sample median, or the sample minimum, or any other statistic that can be computed on a sample. The following code will do just that for a normally distributed population.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe use of these simulations to determine the sampling distribution is an incredibly powerful tool in statistics. It allows us to work with quantities practically, even when the theory is too cumbersome to derive. What is more, the same ideas can be extended to approximate sampling distributions even when the population distribution is not known at all. The process is called bootstrapping, and it is one of the most powerful ideas that has been derived in modern statistics.",

    "text": "13.1 The Role of Estimation, Estimators, and Estimates\nWhen introducing sample statistics, we had been discussing their role as relating to population parameters. That is, to formalize the process we are following we started from the position that there is a population that we wish to learn about, and specifically some parameter(s) in that population whose value we would like to know. Owing to the fundamental limitations we are faced with1 we are unable to directly observe the population in full. As a result, the parameter value remains unknown to us. Instead, we attempt to understand the population by observing a sample. We are able to consider the distribution of this sample via the data distribution, and we are able to compute statistics on this sample. These statistics, intuitively, are connected to the parameter values of interest.2 The sampling distribution of the sample statistics provides one technique for codifying the connection between the parameter value and the value of the statistic that we can compute.\nIn this process it is possible to view statistics as serving two distinct, but related, roles. The first is as a means of describing the true sample. That is, we use statistics in the description of the data distribution, and they provide a description of what we actually observed. The second is as a “guess” as to the value of an unknown parameter. The process of using data to “guess” the value of an unknown parameter is referred to as estimation, and it is one of the primary goals of statistical inference.\nThus, if we are interested in the mean value for some trait in a population, we take a sample, and using this sample compute the sample mean for this value, then we can view this as a procedure to estimate to true mean in the population. This process of estimation will not, generally, give us an exact value for the population parameter, however, if we follow efficient estimation procedures, we can be fairly confident that the reported values will be close to the truth.\nWe will formalize the process of estimation by considering an arbitrary parameter in the population. Suppose that this parameter has an unknown value, denoted \\(\\theta\\).3 Owing to limitations in our ability to directly observe the population, we cannot directly compute \\(\\theta\\). Instead, it is our goal to determine an estimated value for \\(\\theta\\) using data that are observed in a sample. Before we have collected any data at all, we can determine a procedure that we could follow to generate these estimated values. This procedure is referred to as an estimator.\nEstimators are simply statistics that are computed with the goal of approximating the value of a parameter. Thus, any of the statistics that we have seen previously can be viewed as estimators. The sample mean, \\[\\overline{X} = \\widehat{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i,\\] can be viewed as an estimator of the population mean, \\(\\mu\\). The sample variance, \\[S^2 = \\widehat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2,\\] can be viewed as an estimator of the population variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). The defining feature of an estimator is that it is a mathematical function, meaning that it takes in data that may be observed in a sample. An estimator is not a specific numeric value. Because estimators take as input data from a sample, and because we regard the data from samples as being random, estimators are random variables. For instance, the value of the sample mean can be regarded as a random value prior to a sample being observed.\nThe fact that estimators are random variables means that estimators have distributions. Estimators are, however, just statistics. In Chapter 12 we defined the sampling distribution of a statistic. The sampling distribution of a statistic was the distribution of a statistic when it was regarded as a process that takes in random data, and outputs a value. The sampling distribution emerges by considering the repeated sampling of data and the computation of a statistic using these data. Estimators have sampling distributions in exactly the same way. That is, we may consider repeatedly drawing samples from a population of interest. On each of these samples we may apply our estimator to generate a guess as the the parameter value. If we repeated this over many different samples, we would observe many different values computed by the estimator. These values would differ owing to sampling variability. The distribution that emerges from this repeated process is the sampling distribution of an estimator.\nWhile the value of an estimator is random when the estimator is thought of as a mathematical procedure, once we have data, we are able to compute an exact value using the estimator. The value that the sample mean will take on, before we have observed a sample, is unknown and random. However, once we have taken a sample, the value of the sample mean is some fixed number. These fixed values that are computed using estimators are referred to as estimates. We will typically regard estimates as “guesses” of the value of a parameter.\nBecause estimates are constant values, computed for a specific sample, estimates are not random. There is no distribution for estimates. Instead, they are simply numeric values that are tied to the specific sample from which they were computed. Thus, in the population there are parameters, which take on some unknown, constant value. These are not random, however, they are also unobservable. In an attempt to infer the value of a parameter, we can devise a mathematical procedure used for estimation. This procedure, referred to as an estimator, is a random function since it takes in data from an unobserved sample. The distribution of the estimator is the sampling distribution. Once a sample is actually drawn, the estimator can be applied to the sample, producing an estimate. The estimate is a fixed numeric value, and as such is not random. Unlike the parameter value, the value of the estimate is known since it is derived from a sample. The goal of estimation is to have the value of the estimate be a reasonable approximation for the value of the parameter.\nThe process described above is more specifically referred to as point estimation. In point estimation, we form point estimators and generate the corresponding point estimates to approximate the value of a parameter using one, single value. That is, a point estimator outputs a single number that should be our “best guess” to the value of the parameter. Point estimation stands in contrast to interval estimation where instead of making a guess of a single value, we give a range of plausible values that the parameter may take on. Typically, if something is referred to as an “estimator” or an “estimate”, it is implied that this is in reference to a “point estimator” or a “point estimate”. We will investigate interval estimation in the coming chapters.",

With estimation, statistics are computed from data with the explicit goal of providing information about the population.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 13.2 (Estimator) An estimator is a mathematical procedure (function) that takes in observable data (from a sample) and outputs an estimate for a parameter value. Estimators are specific to the parameter that they are attempting to estimate. For instance, if \\(\\theta\\) is an unknown parameter of interest, then we may define \\[\\widehat{\\theta}(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) = \\widehat{\\theta},\\] as a procedure that takes in a sample (\\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\)) and outputs a value. In this framework we hope that, once computed, \\(\\widehat{\\theta} \\approx \\theta\\).\n\n\n\n\nExample 13.1 (Charles’ Excitement for the Hockey Season) As the summer came to a close, Charles began to get very excited about the upcoming hockey season. This time of year is always exciting as teams begin to make roster announcements, and Charles is excitedly scrolling through the list of players currently under contract. When hockey is being played there are typically 6 individuals on the ice at any point for each team, the goalie and 5 skaters. Charles recognizes that this group of 6 players is not a perfectly random sample, but decides to consider it as such anyways. If the 6 players were regarded as a random sample, Charles recognizes that the average weight of the players on the ice at any time could be viewed as an estimator of the average weight of players on the team as a whole.\nCurious as to how such an estimator would behave, Charles records the following data, comprising the weight of every player (in pounds) currently on the roster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n224\n216\n178\n190\n175\n217\n217\n188\n192\n187\n\n\n181\n183\n170\n184\n202\n166\n181\n215\n179\n199\n\n\n196\n217\n192\n178\n230\n212\n209\n188\n202\n193\n\n\n201\n158\n220\n196\n209\n238\n202\n196\n240\n205\n\n\n225\n222\n207\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause this represents the entire population, Charles is able to know that the true average weight for players on this team is 199.5348837 pounds.\n\nDescribe the sampling distribution of the estimator outlined by Charles.\nDescribe how different realizations from the sampling distribution could be generated. Generate several of these values, explaining the procedure.\n(Challenge) construct a histogram that represents the probability mass function for the sampling distribution of the estimator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sampling distribution can be constructed by conceiving of every sample of size \\(6\\) from this population as being equally likely. There are \\(\\dbinom{43}{6}\\) different combinations of \\(6\\) players that can be selected here, and each of these combinations is thought of as being equally likely. Then, with each combination, the sample mean \\[\\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{6}(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6),\\] can be computed. This value will be assigned probability \\[\\frac{1}{\\binom{43}{6}}.\\] Now, it is important to note that there are multiple combinations that will result in the same \\(\\overline{x}\\), and as a result, when summarizing the probabilities some combinations will have higher probability than others. Still, the sampling distribution of the estimator can be conceived of as being the equally likely probability model applied to the sample of \\(6096454\\) possible combinations of players.\nA realization of the sampling distribution is generated by selecting \\(6\\) individuals at random and computing their average weight. For instance, if we number the players from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, \\(1\\) through \\(43\\), then perhaps we select 2, 17, 14, 35, 37, 43 as a sample. These individuals have weights 216, 181, 184, 209, 202, 207, resulting in a sample average of 199.8333333. Note that this is reasonably close to the population mean, but not exactly equal. We can consider doing this several times over.\n\nA sample of 41, 35, 40, 16, 20, 22 produces weights of 225, 209, 205, 166, 199, 217 with a mean of 203.5.\nA sample of 22, 23, 9, 42, 40, 34 produces weights of 217, 192, 192, 222, 205, 196 with a mean of 204.\nA sample of 8, 26, 11, 4, 41, 34 produces weights of 188, 212, 181, 190, 225, 196 with a mean of 198.6666667.\nA sample of 29, 4, 42, 35, 6, 3 produces weights of 202, 190, 222, 209, 217, 178 with a mean of 203.\n\nBecause there are over 6 million possible combinations, it is infeasible to consider this by-hand. Instead, we can use R, for instance, to construct all possible combinations of the sample weights, and plot these together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 13.3 (Estimate) A constant value that is computed using an estimator is referred to as an estimate. An estimate is derived by applying some estimator, \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\), to an observed sample of data, \\(X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2,\\dots, X_n=x_n\\). Once computed, the value of the estimate is regarded as a proxy for the value of the parameter, \\(\\theta\\).\n\n\n\nExample 13.2 (Charles and the Starting Line) Still invested in the upcoming hockey season, Charles decides to continue investigating the weights of the players. Instead of considering the full roster, Charles begins to consider the population as simply the members of the team who will likely be on the ice to start the first game of the season, excluding the goalie. Taking these \\(5\\) individuals as the populations, the relevant weights are: \\(175\\), \\(212\\), \\(230\\), \\(196\\), and \\(201\\). Suppose that these are considered the population, and Charles considers estimating values about this population through the use of samples.\n\nWrite down the complete sampling distribution for the sample mean if samples of size \\(2\\) are taken.\nWrite down an estimate for the population mean if a sample of size \\(3\\) is taken. What estimator did you use?\nSuppose that instead of considering the average, Charles is interested in the minimum weight of the players. What estimator can be used to estimate this value from samples of size \\(4\\)? What is the corresponding sampling distribution.\nDescribe, in relation to this current setup, the difference between the sampling distribution and the population distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a total of \\(\\dbinom{5}{2} = 10\\) possible samples that can be taken. These result in:\n\n\\(175\\), \\(212\\) for a mean of \\(193.5\\)\n\\(175\\), \\(230\\) for a mean of \\(202.5\\)\n\\(175\\), \\(196\\) for a mean of \\(185.5\\)\n\\(175\\), \\(201\\) for a mean of \\(188\\)\n\\(212\\), \\(230\\) for a mean of \\(221\\)\n\\(212\\), \\(196\\) for a mean of \\(204\\)\n\\(212\\), \\(201\\) for a mean of \\(206.5\\)\n\\(230\\), \\(196\\) for a mean of \\(213\\)\n\\(230\\), \\(201\\) for a mean of \\(215.5\\)\n\\(196\\), \\(201\\) for a mean of \\(198.5\\)\n\nThere are no repeated values here and so the sampling distribution is an equally likely probability model with the set of possible outcomes equalling \\[\\mathcal{X} = \\{193.5, 202.5, 182.5, 188, 221, 204, 206.5, 213, 215.5, 198.5\\}.\\] Specifically, each outcome has probability \\(0.1\\).\nSuppose that the sample we obtained was \\(175, 196, 230\\). Then if we used the sample mean as the estimator, we would estimate the value of the population mean to be \\[\\frac{601}{3} = 200.333333.\\]\nWe could consider using the sample minimum as the estimator. In this case, with samples of size \\(4\\) there are \\(5\\) possible samples (one where each observation is held out). In every sample where \\(175\\) is included, it will be the minimum. In the sample where it is not included, the minimum will be \\(196\\). Thus, suppose that we take \\(X_{(1)}\\) to be the sample minimum estimator, then \\[p_{X_{(1)}}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{4}{5} & x = 175 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{5} & x = 196 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}.\\]\nHere, the five measurements of weight correspond to the population. If we sample from these five individuals, then any statistics that are computed using this sample will be an estimate of the relevant value in the population. These samples, containing just a subset of the five weights, are subject to sampling variability based on which individual observations are included or are not included. As a result, if we envision the set of possible samples that could be realized we can discuss the distribution of the statistics via the sampling distribution. These distributions answer the question “if we were to repeatedly sample from this population, what is the probability we will observe particular values for the computed estimate?” For instance, in (c) we saw that if we take samples of size \\(4\\) from the population, there is a \\(0.8\\) probability that the estimated minimum will exactly equal the population minimum. This \\(0.8\\) comes from the sampling distribution of the sample minimum.",

    "text": "13.2 Assessing the Performance of Estimators\nThe process of estimation described above is a seemingly intuitive method for approximating parameter values through the use of sample statistics. However, to this point we have not stopped to consider whether this intuitive procedure actually works well in practice. To remedy this, we need to devise techniques that will allow us to assess the performance of estimators broadly. We want to be sure that, if we are using an estimate as an approximation for a parameter, we can be reasonably certain that this is a justifiable thing to do. While defining the performance of an estimator requires some care, intuitively, an estimator will have better performance if it typically produces estimates that are close to the truth.\n\n13.2.1 The Bias of an Estimator\nOne way to formalize the performance of an estimator is to suggest that we want estimates to be close to the truth, on average. Intuitively, an estimator that is reliable is one that, were it to be computed over and over again, would have a typical value that is close to the parameter. Now, because estimators are random functions and they have distributions, it is also possible to conceive of the expected value of an estimator. If an estimator is reliable it is reasonable to suggest that the expected value of the estimator should be close to the parameter. As a result, we can define a measure of performance based on how far the estimator is from the truth, on average. We call this the bias of an estimator.\n\nDefinition 13.4 (Bias (of an estimator)) The bias of an estimator, \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\), of a parameter \\(\\theta\\) is a measure of the expected difference between the estimator and the truth. That is, \\[\\text{Bias}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = E[\\widehat{\\theta} - \\theta] = E[\\widehat{\\theta}] - \\theta.\\]\n\nAll else equal, it is preferable to have estimators that have a low bias. If the bias is low then on average we expect the estimator to be close to the truth. A low bias provides a reasonable justification for using an estimator in many situations. In the event that the bias of an estimator is shown to be \\(0\\), we call the estimator unbiased.\n\nDefinition 13.5 (Unbiased Estimator) An unbiased estimator is any estimator, \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\), with a bias of \\(0\\). That is, \\[E[\\widehat{\\theta}] - \\theta = 0 \\implies E[\\widehat{\\theta}] = \\theta.\\]\n\nIf an estimator is unbiased then its expectation exactly coincides with the truth. If you were able to take many different samples, compute estimates on each of those samples, and then take the average of those various estimates, an unbiased estimator will have this average coincide with the true parameter value. This is typically a desirable trait, and it is very common to try to find unbiased estimators for parameters of interest. Many of the common estimators that we have seen are unbiased. Despite the utility of unbiased estimators, knowing that something is unbiased is not enough to justify its use. Moreover, it is often possible to find many different unbiased estimators for the same parameter, which nevertheless give different estimates. In these cases it is important to be able to choose between different estimators on the basis of additional performance metrics.\n\nExample 13.3 (Sadie and Charles Explore Bias) Fascinated by having the bias to assess the quality of estimators, Charles and Sadie turn their attention to trying to determine as many ways of estimating population means as they can think of. For each of the following pairs of estimators, assess the bias of each of them and determine which estimator is preferable based on the bias alone.\n\nCharles considers an arbitrary population and suggests that both \\(\\overline{X}\\), the sample mean, as well as \\(X_1\\), the first observation, may be used to estimate the mean of the distribution.\nSadie, thinking of a Poisson distribution, suggests that both the sample variance, \\(S^2\\), as well as \\(\\dfrac{1}{2}(X_1 - X_2)^2\\) may work to estimate \\(\\lambda\\).\nIn a normal population, Charles and Sadie both want to estimate \\(\\mu^2\\). Charles suggests taking the average of \\(X_i^2\\), that is \\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2,\\] while Sadie suggests taking \\(\\overline{X}^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these estimators are unbiased for the truth. To see this note that \\[E[\\overline{X}] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\right] = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i] = \\mu.\\] Similarly, we know that \\(E[X_i] = \\mu\\) for all \\(i = 1,\\dots, n\\) so \\(E[X_1] = \\mu\\). As a result, the bias of both estimators are the same and selecting either is equivalent in terms of the bias.\nRecall that for a Poisson distribution, \\(E[X] = \\text{var}(X) = \\lambda\\). Thus, \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[S^2] &= E\\left[\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2\\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n E[(X_i - \\lambda + \\lambda - \\overline{X})^2] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n E[(X_i - \\lambda)^2] + 2E[(X_i - \\lambda)(\\lambda - \\overline{X})] + E[(\\lambda - \\overline{X})^2] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{var}(X_i) - 2E[(X_i - \\lambda)(\\overline{X} - \\lambda)] + \\text{var}(\\overline{X}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[\\lambda - \\frac{2}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n E[(X_i-\\lambda)(X_j-\\lambda)] + \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[\\lambda - \\frac{2}{n}E[(X_i-\\lambda)^2] + \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda - \\frac{\\lambda}{n} \\\\\n&= \\lambda.\n\\end{align*}\\] On the other hand, we have that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  E\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(X_1 - X_2)^2\\right] &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(E[X_1^2] - 2E[X_1X_2] + E[X_2^2]\\right)\\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left((\\lambda + \\lambda^2) - 2E[X_1]E[X_2] + (\\lambda + \\lambda^2)\\right) \\\\\n  &= \\lambda.\n\\end{align*}\\] As a result, both of the proposed estimators are unbiased and just as in the previous case, they cannot be selected between one another based on bias alone.\nFirst, consider the expected value of Charles’ estimator. Notably, \\[\\begin{align*}\nE\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2\\right] &= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i^2] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2) \\\\\n&= \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2.\n\\end{align*}\\] Meanwhile, for Sadie’s estimator we find \\[\\begin{align*}\n  E\\left[\\overline{X}^2\\right] &= \\text{var}(\\overline{X}) + E[\\overline{X}]^2 \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\mu^2.\n\\end{align*}\\] As a result, both estimators are biased. The one proposed by Charles has a bias of \\[\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2 - \\mu^2 = \\sigma^2,\\] while Sadie’s has a bias of \\[\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\mu^2 - \\mu^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}.\\] As a result, Sadie’s estimator has a smaller bias and is preferable in that regard.\n\nIn a normal population, Charles and Sadie both want to estimate \\(\\mu^2\\). Charles suggests taking the average of \\(X_i^2\\), that is \\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2,\\] while Sadie suggests taking \\(\\overline{X}^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Note on Variance Estimation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard technique for computing the sample variance is to take \\[\\widehat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2.\\] This is a slightly strange formula for the sample variance where it would feel far more natural for \\[\\widehat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2.\\] However, the reason that the first technique is typically used is because it is an unbiased estimator, where the more natural version is biased. To see this consider \\[\\begin{align*}\n    E[\\widehat{\\sigma}^2] &= E\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2\\right] \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n E[(X_i - \\mu + \\mu - \\overline{X})^2] \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n E[(X_i - \\mu)^2] + 2E[(X_i - \\mu)(\\mu - \\overline{X})] + E[(\\mu - \\overline{X})^2] \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{var}(X_i) - 2E[(X_i - \\mu)(\\overline{X} - \\mu)] + \\text{var}(\\overline{X}) \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[\\sigma^2 - \\frac{2}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n E[(X_i-\\mu)(X_j-\\mu)] + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right] \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[\\sigma^2 - \\frac{2}{n}E[(X_i-\\mu)^2] + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right] \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sigma^2 - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\\\\n    &= \\sigma^2.\n\\end{align*}\\] Note that in this derivation, the first step simply adds \\(0\\) (by adding and subtract \\(\\mu\\)). Moreover, when trying to find \\(E[(X_i - \\mu)(X_j - \\mu)]\\) we use the fact that if \\(i\\neq j\\) then \\(X_i \\perp X_j\\) and so \\[E[(X_i - \\mu)(X_j - \\mu)] = E[(X_i - \\mu)]E[(X_j - \\mu)],\\] which is zero. Thus, dividing by \\(n-1\\) gives an unbiased estimator for \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nNote that this means that if we instead divided by \\(n\\) we would find that the bias were \\[\\frac{n-1}{n}\\sigma^2 - \\sigma^2 = \\frac{-\\sigma^2}{n}.\\] As \\(n\\) increases this bias tends towards \\(0\\) and the differences between the two estimators is minimal.\n\n\n\nWhen we summarized random variables with location summaries we saw that the variability inherent in the random variable was missed. We can think of bias as being a measure of the estimators location, relative to the truth. In this sense the variability of the estimator is also overlooked when reporting bias. We may consider two estimators, each of which is unbiased for the truth. In terms of their average location, there is no difference between the two of them. However, it may be the case that one of the estimators is far more variable than the other. If this is so then we know that, while on average it will equal the true value, we will also expect it to be further from the truth on any given realization. That is, a good estimator is one that is close to the truth on average, but that also is not too variable. If the estimator moves around a lot, it is less reliable, and any given estimate from the estimator may be likely to be quite far from the truth. Thus, just as with random variables we needed to include measures of location and variability, so too with estimators should include measures of the bias and variance.\n\n\n13.2.2 The Variance of an Estimator\nRemembering that estimators are random variables and are realizations from a sampling distribution, we are able to discuss the variance of an estimator in exactly the same way as we would discuss the variance of any random quantity.\n\nDefinition 13.6 (Variance of an Estimator) The variance of an estimator is the variance of the sampling distribution of the estimator. That is, an estimator \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\), will have variance given by \\[\\text{var}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = E[(\\widehat{\\theta} - E[\\widehat{\\theta}])^2] = E[\\widehat{\\theta}^2] - E[\\widehat{\\theta}]^2.\\] If an estimator is unbiased then \\(E[\\widehat{\\theta}] = \\theta\\) and the variance simplifies to \\[\\text{var}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = E[\\widehat{\\theta}^2] - \\theta^2.\\]\n\nThe variance of an estimator can be interpreted in much the same way as the variance of any random variable is. Specifically, variance is a measure of the spread around an estimator’s mean. If the process of drawing samples and computing estimates were to be repeated over and over again, then a higher variance estimator will have more spread in the estimates that are computed as compared to a lower variance estimator. In this sense, the variance of an estimator serves as a measure of the reliability of the estimator. It is typically preferable, all else equal, to have an estimator with low variability. This gives more confidence that any estimate that is computed is likely to be near any other estimate that could have been computed, with less susceptibility to the specifics of the random sample.4\n\nExample 13.4 (Sadie and Charles Moved Beyond Bias) Content in their exploration of bias alone, Sadie and Charles realize that they must be missing part of the picture. In particular, they found two estimators that have equivalent bias but, intuitively, they each know that they are not equivalent estimators. They want to understand why that is. Together, they set out to investigate the two estimators that Charles was considering for the population mean of an arbitrary distribution.\n\nIn an arbitrary population, is \\(\\overline{X}\\), the sample mean, or \\(X_1\\), the first observation, a better estimator for the mean of the distribution? Why?\nSuppose that an estimator is considered of the form \\[\\widehat{\\theta} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_iX_i,\\] where \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i = 1\\). Then the sample mean takes \\(\\omega_i = \\dfrac{1}{n}\\) for all \\(i\\), and the first point takes \\(\\omega_1 = 1\\) and \\(\\omega_i = 0\\) for all other points. How does this general estimator compare to the sample mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sample mean is a better estimator than the first observation. The bias is the same for each estimator and so we can directly compare the variance. The variance of \\(\\overline{X}\\) is \\[\\text{var}(\\overline{X}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}.\\] On the other hand, the first data point, \\(X_1\\), will have variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). As a result, the variance for the single estimator is \\(n\\) times larger than the variance of the sample mean, justifying its use instead.\nFirst, we consider the bias. Note that \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[\\widehat{\\theta}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_iX_i\\right] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_iE[X_i] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i\\mu \\\\\n&= \\mu\\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i = \\mu.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, the estimator is unbiased. Then, to consider the variance of the estimator we get \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\text{var}(\\widehat{\\theta}) &= \\text{var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_iX_i\\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{var}(\\omega_iX_i) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i^2\\text{var}(X_i) \\\\\n&= \\sigma^2\\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i^2.\n\\end{align*}\\] Then, the variance of the estimator depends on \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i^2\\).5\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many cases the variance of an estimator becomes a secondary consideration once the bias is known to be small. If you have shown a comparatively small bias for two estimators then by reducing the variance of the estimator you are increasing the probability that the estimates produced will be near the truth. This becomes especially relevant when the estimators under consideration are unbiased. When comparing two unbiased estimators, the natural point of comparison is in the variance. We know that on average both estimators will produce estimates of the truth. To have a more useful estimator for a single sample, however, we want the one that will more reliability produce values that are close to the truth, which is to say, the lower variance estimator. In fact, if we consider only unbiased estimators, then it would be most ideal to search for the unbiased estimator with the lowest possible variance, the so-called minimum variance unbiased estimator.\n\nDefinition 13.7 (Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator (MVUE)) The minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) is the unbiased estimator for a parameter that has the smallest possible variance among all unbiased estimators for that parameter. That is, if \\(\\widehat{\\theta}^*\\) is the MVUE, and \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is any estimator such that \\(E[\\widehat{\\theta}] = \\theta\\), then \\[\\text{var}(\\widehat{\\theta}^*) \\leq \\text{var}(\\widehat{\\theta}).\\]\n\nGenerally, the MVUE will depend on both the underlying population distribution and on the parameter that is being estimated. It is also often the case that MVUEs are not feasible to find. However, in cases where they are known and easy to calculate, there is a strong justification for their application. Specifically, the MVUE is guaranteed to be the lowest variance estimator among any estimator that will be correct on average. Some commonly applied estimators happen to be the MVUEs. For instance, if the data are normally distributed then \\(\\overline{X}\\) is the MVUE for \\(\\mu\\). Moreover, if the data are from a binomial distribution, then \\(\\widehat{p}\\), the sample proportion, is the MVUE for \\(p\\). In general, however, the sample mean will not be the MVUE for the population mean, nor will the sample variance be the MVUE for the population variance. Despite this, the sample mean and variance remain useful estimators for their respective parameters. Why is this the case?\nThe MVUE codifies one possible condition for the optimality of an estimator. That is, if we define the optimal estimator to be unbiased and with low variance, then the MVUE is optimal. However, this is a rather restrictive definition for optimality. Specifically, requiring estimators to be unbiased removes many useful estimators that wind-up performing better on average. Often it will be possible to sacrifice a little bit in terms of the bias for major gains in terms of the variance. Doing this may be worthwhile, undermining the optimality of the MVUE. What’s more, the MVUE only considers the properties of bias and variance in performance assessment. While the bias and variance are the most commonly applied metrics for estimator performance, other considerations are often useful, depending on the context.\n\n\n13.2.3 The Mean Squared Error, Accuracy, and Precision\nThe MVUE achieves a fairly restrictive trade-off between the bias and variance of the estimator. Specifically, by only considering estimators that are unbiased, the MVUE begins from a restrictive place. As was previously argued, it is important to consider both the mean and the variance when assessing the performance on estimator, though, that does not specifically necessitate considering unbiased estimators. Instead, we may wish to consider estimators that are able to be biased, but only if there is a sufficient reduction in variance to justify this. In essence, we are hoping to find estimators that minimize both quantities simultaneously. As it turns out, this is well-summarized through the use of the mean squared error.\n\nDefinition 13.8 (Mean Squared Error) The mean squared error (MSE) of an estimator is the expected square distance between the estimator and the true value of the parameter. If \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is an estimator for \\(\\theta\\), then \\[\\text{MSE}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = E[(\\widehat{\\theta} - \\theta)^2].\\]\n\nEstimators with lower MSE values are typically preferred, all else equal. The MSE of an estimator at first glance appears to be similar to the variance. However, where in the variance the squared distance is computed to the expected value of the estimator, \\(E[\\widehat{\\theta}]\\), for the MSE the squared distance is computed to the true value of the estimator, \\(\\theta\\). Note that for unbiased estimators we know that \\(E[\\widehat{\\theta}] = \\theta\\), and so if the bias of an estimator is \\(0\\), then the MSE is exactly equal to the variance. However, even when the bias of the estimator is non-zero, the MSE still balances the bias and the variance of the estimator. This is best seen through the bias-variance decomposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bias-Variance Decomposition\n\n\n\nThe mean squared error of an estimator can be decomposed such that \\[\\text{MSE}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = \\text{Bias}(\\widehat{\\theta})^2 + \\text{var}(\\widehat{\\theta}).\\] In this way, reducing the MSE is akin to the simultaneous reduction of the bias and the variance, allowing a trade-off between them.\n\n\nThe decomposition of the MSE into the bias and variance formalizes the notion that we wish to simultaneously minimize each quantity. It also directly allows us to consider the tradeoff between bias and variance that is inherent in much of statistics. Often, by reducing the variance of an estimator you must incur extra bias, or by reducing the bias, you must incur extra variance. The MSE provides a metric to consider to understand when these tradeoffs are worthwhile and when they are not. In a sense, finding minimal MSE estimators is a generalization of the procedure of finding the MVUE. In this case, however, we are permitted to consider estimators which have positive bias (so long as their reduced variance justifies consideration).\n\nExample 13.5 (Charles and Sadie Consider Variance Estimators) When introduced originally, Charles was quite perturbed by the sample variance formula and the division by \\(n-1\\). In a conversation with Sadie, Charles expressed some frustration that the formula should just divide by \\(n\\). What’s the big difference between the two, after all? Sadie, remembering this conversation, returns to Charles and points out that at least they now understand that the \\(n-1\\) exists to make the estimator unbiased. Charles was satisfied until learning of the MSE and bias-variance decomposition. “Why not sacrifice some bias in exchange for a more interpretable formula? What is really being lost?” Sadie points out that they could answer this by considering the MSE of the estimators. Charles thinks that is a great idea and recalls reading somewhere that, in a normal population, the variance of \\(S^2\\) is \\(\\dfrac{2\\sigma^4}{n-1}\\).\n\nWhat is the MSE of \\(S^2\\)?\nWhat is the MSE of the variance estimator that divides by \\(n\\) in place of \\(n-1\\)?\nFrustrated by the arbitrariness, Charles declares, “Why not divide by \\(n+1\\) instead?” If this were done, what would the MSE be?\nWhich of the three estimators is quantitatively the best?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that given that \\(E[S^2] = \\sigma^2\\), the bias of the estimator is \\(0\\). As a result, \\[\\text{MSE}(S^2) = \\text{var}(S^2) = \\frac{2}{n-1}\\sigma^4.\\]\nTo find the MSE we consider first the bias. We know that the estimator can be written as \\(\\dfrac{n-1}{n}S^2\\) and so \\[E\\left[\\frac{n-1}{n}S^2\\right] = \\frac{n-1}{n}E[S^2] = \\frac{n-1}{n}\\sigma^2.\\] Thus, the bias is given by \\[\\frac{n-1}{n}\\sigma^2 - \\sigma^2 = \\frac{-\\sigma^2}{n}.\\] We can perform a similar calculation for the variance, giving \\[\\text{var}\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n}S^2\\right) = \\frac{(n-1)^2}{n^2}\\text{var}(S^2) = 2\\frac{(n-1)}{n^2}\\sigma^4.\\] Then we get that \\[\\text{MSE}(S_{n}^2) = \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)^2 + 2\\frac{(n-1)}{n^2}\\sigma^4 = \\frac{2n - 1}{n^2}\\sigma^4.\\]\nWe can use a similar procedure here. Note that \\[S_{n+1}^2 = \\frac{n-1}{n+1}S^2\\] and so for the bias we get \\[\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n+1} - 1\\right)\\sigma^2 = \\frac{-2\\sigma^2}{n+1}.\\] Then, working on the variance we find \\[\\text{var}(S_{n+1}^2) = 2\\frac{(n-1)}{(n+1)^2}\\sigma^4.\\] Thus, combined the MSE is given by \\[\\text{MSE}(S_{n+1}^2) = \\frac{2n + 2}{(n+1)^2}\\sigma^4 = \\frac{2}{n+1}\\sigma^4.\\]\nWe can compare the three different MSEs either algebraically, graphically, or via example. The following graph plots their respective values for \\(n=2\\) through to \\(n=30\\). Note that if \\(n=1\\) then all estimators will produce \\(0\\) so it is not a valid point of comparison. Also note that this is simply graphing the constant multiple of \\(\\sigma^4\\). This can be interpreted as either a case where \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\) or else as the multiple of the squared variance that is relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the lowest MSE is the estimator dividing by \\(n+1\\), followed by that dividing by \\(n\\), followed by the standard variance estimator. Algebraically it is clear the see that \\(\\text{MSE}(S^2) \\geq \\text{MSE}(S_{n+1}^2)\\), since dividing by \\(n+1\\) will be smaller for all \\(n\\). While it is slightly more involved, it is possible to show that dividing by \\(n\\) will always fall between these two. That is, quantitatively, the best estimator (of those considered) for the variance of a normal population is the sample variance that divides by \\(n+1\\) rather than by \\(n-1\\).\n\n\n\n\nThe innate tradeoff between the bias and variance of estimators is understandable through its analogue in accuracy and precision. When speaking of the bias of an estimator we are speaking primarily of the accuracy of the estimator. To say that the bias is low is to say that, on average, we expect the estimated values to center on the truth. On average, a low bias estimator will be nearly correct. This says nothing to how tightly the points concentrate around the truth. In contrast, the variance of the estimator is a measure of the precision of the estimator. A low variance estimator will frequently take values that are clustered around one another. This cluster may or may not be near the true value, however, there will be minimal spread in them. A perfect estimator would have high accuracy (low bias) and high precision (low variance), however, it will often be the case that we can achieve on aim or the other. Using the MSE allows us to quantitatively consider the tradeoffs between accuracy and precision, and find an estimator that strikes a good balance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: A plot demonstrating the difference between high accuracy (with low precision) and high precision (with low accuracy). Higher accuracy refers to the tendency to be centered correctly on the truth. High precision refers for the tendency to be tightly clustered together. The accuracy is analogous to the bias of an estimator where the precision is analogous to the variance of an estimator. The mean squared error combines both concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, unless otherwise specified, the best estimator to use in a given situation will be the estimator with the lowest MSE. There may be scenarios where an unbiased estimator is particularly important, in which case, you may instead search for the MVUE. Alternatively, there may scenarios where the precision is of utmost importance, seeking the lowest variance estimator among those that are reasonable. Still, more often than not, the minimal MSE estimator will be preferred from a performance perspective. With that said, there are occasionally considerations beyond the bias or variance of an estimator that ought to be considered when assessing performance.\n\n\n13.2.4 Conditions Beyond the Mean Squared Error\nWhile it is typically the case that our primary concern is the MSE of an estimator, there are other considerations that we may need to make on occasion. It is important to always consider that we are assessing estimators for a particular purpose in a particular setting. The generality of the MSE rule makes it a useful place to start, however, we should always be cognizant of the particular demands of our scenario. For instance, the bias, variance, and MSE of an estimator are all dependent on the sampling distribution of the estimator. The sampling distribution, in turn, will often depend on the population distribution. As a result, estimators that minimize the MSE will typically only minimize the MSE for a specific population distribution. If the estimator is applied to data drawn from a different population, the MSE will typically change. As a result, if we are uncertain about the population distribution we may prefer to find an estimator that will perform well regardless of what the truth happens to be, even if it has a higher MSE for certain populations than other estimators. This is a measure of the robustness of an estimator.\n\nDefinition 13.9 (Robust (Estimator)) Roughly speaking, an estimator is said to be robust if the estimator performs well even when the distributional assumptions made regarding the estimators are incorrect.\n\nRobustness is a property which, when present, gives more certainty that the estimators will perform well in practice. There are also practical considerations we may need to make regarding estimators. For instance, we may be concerned with how well we are able to compute estimates using the estimators. If an estimator is theoretically performant, but in practice, it requires substantial computational resources to calculate, then it may not be practical in use. Additionally, there may be assumptions beyond the distributional assumptions addressed with robustness required for certain estimators. It may be preferable to select an estimator with fewer assumptions, or perhaps, less restrictive assumptions, even if that means sacrificing quantitative performance. One final consideration that may be required is the popularity of the estimator. In certain fields there are expected analytical pathways since the individuals working or researching in those fields are used to interpreting particular estimators. In these cases, even if a more performant estimator exists, the added utility of estimating quantities that others know and understand, and the capacity to compare to work that was previously done, may be a benefit worthy of consideration.\n\nExample 13.6 (Understanding the Sample Variance Estimator) Charles and Sadie continue to discuss the sample variance estimator. After determining (Example 13.5) that the MSE of the estimator that divides by \\(n+1\\) has a better MSE than the estimator that divides by \\(n-1\\), Charles is perturbed that it has become so common to take the sample variance to be defined as the unbiased estimator. When discussing with Sadie, Charles notes that unbiasedness is only one small part of an estimators performance, and that it is an arbitrary decision to select it. Sadie, sensing the frustration that Charles feel at the scenario, suggests that they do an exercise together of making an argument in favour of each of the three estimators that they have been studying, \\(S^2\\), \\(S_{n}^2\\), and, \\(S_{n+1}^2\\).\nWhat may the arguments include?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFor \\(S^2\\), the primary argument quantitatively is that it is unbiased. Moreover, for even moderate \\(n\\), the reduction in the MSE that the other estimators achieve over \\(S^2\\) will be minimal, and as such, the unbiasedness is a desirable property. Moreover, when sample variances are computed and reported, it is most common that they will be computed and reported according to \\(S^2\\). As a result, it is important for interpretability and communication to estimate variance in the same manner when discussing results with other people.\nFor \\(S_n^2\\), the primary argument is that it is conceptually straightforward. It mirrors the sample mean, and feels far less arbitrary than either \\(S^2\\) or \\(S_{n+1}^2\\). While the estimator is biased, for moderate \\(n\\) the bias will be fairly small, and despite the bias, the MSE is an improvement over the MSE of \\(S^2\\). As a result, you can gain simplicity of the estimator, improve the performance in terms of MSE, and only minimally sacrifice on the bias.\nFor \\(S_{n+1}^2\\), the primary argument is that it is the best estimator by the standards of the MSE. When considering accuracy and precision jointly, it will perform better than either \\(S^2\\) or \\(S_n^2\\). What is more, the bias that the estimator has is minimal for even moderate \\(n\\). The added complexity of the formula feels no more complex, and no more arbitrary, than the complexity in the formula for taking \\(n-1\\), and this complexity could be justified by appealing to the optimality of the estimator.\n\n\n\n\nThere are undoubtedly considerations beyond those listed here that may be worth considering. The overarching point is that, ultimately, estimators are meant to be tools that provide useful information in particular settings. It is important to keep the context of the estimation problem in mind when selecting an estimator, rather than simply deferring to a rigid quantitative principle.",

For instance, we were concerned with the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), and as such it made sense to consider the sample mean, \\(\\overline{X}\\), as an estimator. This is a reasonable approach for parameters that map well onto descriptive statistics, however, many distributions will be characterized by parameters that do not have well-studied sample variants. Despite this, there will still often be a need to derive estimators for these parameters. As a result, it is desirable to have strategies that can be applied in order to derive estimators for parameters of interest in general. We refer to such strategies as estimation procedures.\nThere are two particularly prominent estimation procedures, which together, cover many of the most common estimators in frequent use. These are maximum likelihood estimators and method of moment estimators. In maximum likelihood estimation, the goal is to determine the parameter value that, if it were the correct value, would result in the highest likelihood of observing the sample that is observed. These estimators are in frequent use and have many desirable theoretical properties. Calculating the maximum likelihood estimator relies on differential calculus, as it necessitates us solving optimization problems.6 Method of moments estimators, on the other hand, take the intuitive idea of matching sample and population statistics directly, and generalize this to account for arbitrary parameters to be estimated. As a result, the method of moments procedure is quite intuitive, and provides an accessible introduction to general estimation techniques.",

To understand this fully, we start by defining moments.\n\nDefinition 13.10 ((Population) Moments) The \\(k\\)th population moment of a random variable \\(X\\) is defined to be $\\(m_K = E[X^k]\\). Thus, the expected value is the first population moment, \\(E[X^2]\\) is the second, and so forth. In general, if the population distribution is characterized by a parameter \\(\\theta\\), then the population moments will be functions of the unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\).\n\nThe population moments can, in a sense, be thought of as containing most of the information in the distribution. As a result, two distributions that share the same set moments can, in many situations, be thought of as the same distribution. Thus, if an estimator of \\(\\theta\\) reproduces the population moments then this estimator can be regarded as a useful estimator, at least in theory. As a result, in method of moments estimation, we match population moments to sample moments.\n\nDefinition 13.11 (Sample Moments) The \\(k\\)th sample moment of a random sample, \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\), is given by the sample average of \\(X_i^k\\). That is, \\[\\widehat{m}_k = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^k.\\] The \\(k\\)th sample moment can be regarded as an estimator for the \\(k\\)th population moment. Moreover, the \\(k\\)th sample moment will be unbiased for the \\(k\\)th population moment.\n\nGiven an observed sample it is possible to calculate specific values for any sample moment. We know that these estimators are unbiased for the corresponding population moments, and that the corresponding population moments are functions of the unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\). This motivates the method of moments estimation procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod of Moments Procedure\n\n\n\nSuppose that a population is characterized by an unknown parameter, \\(\\theta\\). Suppose that \\(\\theta\\) has \\(L\\) components. The goal is to estimate \\(\\theta\\) using a sample \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\). To proceed, the method of moments estimator, \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_\\text{MoM}\\), is calculated as follows:\n\nCompute the first \\(L\\) population moments, \\(m_1,\\dots,m_L\\) producing \\(L\\) functions of \\(\\theta\\). Note, if any of the first \\(L\\) population moments do not depend on \\(\\theta\\), continue computing these until there are \\(L\\) equations.\nCompute the \\(L\\) sample moments, \\(\\widehat{m}_1,\\dots,\\widehat{m}_L\\), corresponding to each of the population moments computed.\nFor each \\(j = 1, \\dots, L\\), set \\[m_j(\\theta) = \\widehat{m}_j.\\]\nFinally, simultaneously solve the \\(L\\) equations for \\(\\theta\\).\n\nThe solution to these equations produces \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_\\text{MoM}\\).\n\n\n\nExample 13.7 (Charles Estimates the Weight Distribution of Hockey Players) With a firmer understanding of estimation procedures, Charles returns to the earlier fascination regarding the weights of professional hockey players. In particular, Charles, making the assumption that the weights across the entire league are normally distributed with a mean of \\(\\mu\\) and a variance of \\(\\sigma^2\\), wants to estimate these values from a sample of \\(5\\) observations.\n\nWrite down the method of moments estimators for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) in a normal population.\nIf Charles samples 188, 212, 181, 190, 225, 196, what are the estimated values for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we find the population moments. Note that \\(E[X] = \\mu\\). Moreover, we know that \\(\\sigma^2 = E[X^2] - E[X]^2\\), and so \\(E[X^2] = \\sigma^2 + E[X]^2 = \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2\\). Thus, taking \\(\\widehat{m}_1\\) and \\(\\widehat{m}_2\\) to be the first two sample moments, we get: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\mu &= \\widehat{m}_1 \\\\\n  \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2 &= \\widehat{m}_2 \\\\\n  \\implies \\sigma^2 &= \\widehat{m}_2 - \\mu^2 \\\\\n  &= \\widehat{m}_2 - \\widehat{m}_1^2.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, the estimators are \\(\\widehat{m}_1\\) and \\(\\widehat{m}_2 - \\widehat{m}_1^2\\), respectively.\nIn this sample we can find that \\(\\widehat{m}_1\\) is given by 198.6667 and that \\(\\widehat{m}_2\\) is given by 39698.33. 7 Taking these values into the formula derived in the previous part gives an estimate for \\(\\mu\\) as 198.6667 and and estimate for \\(\\sigma^2\\) as 229.8889.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 13.8 (Sadie’s Game) Sadie has started playing a new game with Charles. The game goes as follows. First, Sadie selects a random sized die, without Charles seeing the die. Then, Sadie will roll the die and flip a coin. If the coin comes up heads, the number that turned up on the die is told to Charles. If the coin comes up tails, the number is reported as a negative value. Charles does not see this process at all, and is just told that a string of numbers from a discrete uniform distribution between \\(-a\\) and \\(a\\) will be reported.\n\nIf Charles gets to hear \\(n\\) numbers and then has to guess \\(a\\), what is the method of moments estimator that could be used?\nSuppose that Charles observes -5, 2, 3, 0. What is the method of moments estimate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to derive the population moments. Note that for the discrete uniform on the interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) we have \\[E[X] = \\frac{a+b}{2}.\\] Thus, in this case that results in \\(E[X] = 0\\). As a result, we must turn to the second population moment in order to use the method of moments estimators since \\(E[X]\\) does not depend on \\(\\theta\\). To this end we have \\[\\text{var}(X) = \\frac{(a - (-a) + 1)^2 - 1}{12} = \\frac{(2a + 1)^2 - 1}{12}.\\] Note that here, \\(\\text{var}(X) = E[X^2]\\), since \\(E[X] = 0\\). Thus, we can set \\(\\widehat{m}_2\\) equal to this moment and solve for \\(a\\). This gives \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(2a + 1)^2 - 1}{12} &= \\widehat{m}_2 \\\\\n4a^2 + 4a + 1 - 1 - 12\\widehat{m}_2 &= 0 \\\\\na^2 + a - 3\\widehat{m}_2 &= 0 \\\\\n\\implies a &= \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 12\\widehat{m}_2}}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Since \\(a\\) is positive, we need only consider the positive root in this case, giving \\(\\widehat{a} = \\dfrac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + 12\\widehat{m}_2}}{2}\\).\nFrom this sample, the second sample moment is equal to 9.5. Thus, applying the result from above this would give estimates of either 4.8619.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuitively, this procedures takes the population moments, matches them to the sample moments, and defines the estimator to be the value of the parameter that equates these two sets of quantities. This is a reasonable sounding approach to derive estimators and, in practice, method of moments estimators perform quite well. Specifically, the method of moments estimators tend to be fairly robust to distributional assumptions, making them appropriate across a wide variety of populations and modelling scenarios. Beyond the robustness and intuitiveness, the method of moments estimators tend to be fairly performant, and are often easy to compute. All of these factors make this an attractive estimation technique in practice. With that said, there are some notable shortcomings of the method of moments procedure.\n\n13.4.1 Shortcomings of the Method of Moments Procedure\nThere are three shortcomings of the method of moments procedures. Whether these shortcomings will override the utility and benefits of these techniques will depend on the specific scenario in which the estimators are being applied. The first concern is that, in order to calculate the method of moments estimators, we must assume that the population moments actually exist. While it is uncommon in practice, there are many distributions which do not have moments, or do not have all of their moments, and in these settings, it is not possible to use the method of moments technique at all. Second, the method of moments estimators tend to be biased for the true parameter values. This is not universally true, however, in most scenarios with even moderate complexity, the resulting estimators will not be unbiased. As discussed previously, the existence of bias does not disqualify an estimator from being useful or performant, however, it can be a shortcoming of the technique in certain settings. Finally, the estimates produced through the method of moments are not guaranteed to be valid estimates for the parameters. For instance, using method of moments estimators may result in variances that are negative, proportions greater than one, or other impossible estimates. These estimates can often be assessed to be evidently incorrect when they arise in practice, however, the fact that such estimates are possible at all can render the methods of moments to be of limited utility in certain scenarios.\n\n\n13.4.2 Method of Moment Estimation in R\nWhile it will often be the case that explicit forms for the method of moments estimators can be derived, this is not always straightforward, and not always desired. Instead, we may choose to leverage R to numerically work out the estimator for the method of moments, rather than doing so by hand. There are several possible approaches to this depending on the size of the parameter, \\(\\theta\\), that we wish to estimate as well as on the information that we already know. In particular, if \\(\\theta\\) is a single parameter then we can use a more straightforward technique compared to if \\(\\theta\\) is multidimensional. Further, we will differentiate the scenario where we know the closed form version of the population moments from those scenarios where we are only aware of the underlying distribution.\n\nOne Dimensional Parameter with Known Moment\nIn the simplest case we have a single dimensional parameter, \\(\\theta\\), and we know the population moments. In this case we can make use of the R uniroot function, which solves for the value of \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x) = 0\\) for some specified function. To use uniroot, we need to provide the function that we wish to solve for the root of, as well as an interval over which we are searching for a root. The idea is that we will define a function, \\[f(\\widehat{\\theta}) = m_1(\\widehat{\\theta}) - \\widehat{m}_1.\\] The value for which \\(f\\) is equal to \\(0\\) will correspond to the value for \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) that equates \\(m_1 = \\widehat{m}_1\\), which is what is required for a single dimensional parameter. Consider, for instance, the exponential distribution, characterized by a single parameter \\(\\lambda\\). The first moment of an exponential distribution is \\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\). In this case we will have \\(\\theta = \\lambda\\) as a single dimensional parameter, and so we can use the following procedure.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nOne Dimensional Parameter with Unknown Moment\nIf the moment is unknown then it is often still possible to workout the method of moment estimator, however, it is required to use R to solve for the approximate moment(s) of the distribution in place of using the closed form solution. This will typically be less efficient, and there may be stability concerns with the computation, however, in many scenarios this will provide a quicker technique for approximating the solution. To do so we will make use of either sum for discrete distributions or integrate for continuous distributions. Note that if \\(X\\) is discrete then \\[E[X^k] = \\sum_{x} x^kp_X(x),\\] and if \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable then \\[E[X^k] = \\int_{x} x^kf_X(x)dx.\\] As long as we know either \\(p_X(x)\\) or \\(f_X(x)\\) then we can leverage R to directly compute these values. Consider the same example as above, without assuming knowledge of exp.moment1.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice that these estimates are effectively identical to the above estimates when the population moments were assumed to be known. Note that effectively the same procedure can be applied in the case of a discrete random variable however, instead of integrating over x, we form a vector of the outputs of \\(xp_X(x)\\) and then sum over this. For instance, suppose that we have a hypergeometric distribution where we do not know the number of ‘success’ items, but we do know that there are \\(100\\) items in total and that our sample will be of size \\(10\\).\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nMultidimensional Parameters\nThe same general procedure can be applied when \\(\\theta\\) has more than one parameter. The changes that are required are two-fold. First, it is required to define multiple functions for the required population moments and, correspondingly, multiple equations to set to be equal to zero. Second, the uniroot function only applies for one dimensional equations and so we must instead use a technique designed for higher dimensional solving. For instance, the multiroot function from the rootSolve package can be applied. Alternatively, we can turn this into an optimization rather than a root finding problem and apply optim. Beyond these changes the process is similar. The functions for population moments can either be explicitly encoded or approximated numerically, and the process will work whether there is a discrete or continuous random variable under consideration. While the procedure is conceptually straightforward, root finding and optimization in multiple dimensions can be fairly unstable computationally. As a result, it will often be the case that other tricks from computational statistics are required in order to accurately determine the roots of the functions, and in turn, solve for the method of moments estimation. For the interested, I would advise you looking into the documentation on multiroot and optim, however, a deeper exploration of these packages is beyond the scope of these notes.",

    "text": "14.1 Interval Estimation and Quantifying Uncertainty\nThe primary concern with point estimation is that, regardless of the procedure we use, we never expect that \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) will equal the true parameter, \\(\\theta\\). Instead, by using statistically valid estimation techniques, we hope to have estimators that are close to the truth. Moreover, using the sampling distribution, or assessing the MSE of an estimator can quantify how close is close. Still, even the most performant estimators are unlikely to exactly equal the truth. What’s more, reporting the estimated value will not, on its own, convey any information about the reliability of the estimator. To solve these issues we can turn to interval estimation. Specifically, with interval estimation we form estimators that do not give a single value for a parameter of interest, but rather, a range of plausible values.\nThere are several different types of interval estimators, including confidence intervals, credible intervals, likelihood intervals, and prediction intervals. Confidence intervals are rooted in frequentist probability theory, the framework we have been exploring throughout, and will serve as the primary focus of this chapter.1 With any interval estimator the goal is to not only provide an estimate of the likely value of a parameter, but also to quantify the uncertainty around this estimate. Providing the interval communicates that, while it is suspected that the parameter is near the point estimate, it is not possible to be entirely sure of exactly where. When reported intervals are more narrow, there is a higher level of precision attributed to the estimate. When reported intervals are wider, there is less certainty ascribed to the estimate. As a result, interval estimates convey a significant amount of information about the parameter, and the estimation procedure that was used.",

    "text": "14.2 Confidence Intervals in General\nIdeally, we would like to be able to form an interval that has a direct probability statement associated with it. For instance, we may wish to form an interval, \\((a, b)\\), such that \\(P(\\theta \\in (a, b))\\) is known explicitly. Unfortunately, in the frequentist paradigm, \\(\\theta\\) is not a random quantity. The statement \\(P(\\theta \\in (a, b))\\) is akin to writing \\(P(2 \\in (4, 6))\\): this probability is either \\(0\\) or it is \\(1\\).2 We need to hold in mind that the uncertainty in estimation does not stem from the parameter value, \\(\\theta\\), and instead stems from the estimator, \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) (and its sampling distribution).\nThe statement \\(P(\\widehat{\\theta} \\in (a, b))\\) can be interpreted as a sensible probability, where here the probability is taken with respect to the sampling distribution. To form our confidence intervals, we start with this idea. Specifically, we attempt to find values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(P(a \\leq \\widehat{\\theta} \\leq b) = p\\) for some suitably high threshold, \\(p\\). This interval, \\((a, b)\\), can be thought of as an interval that will contain the estimated value with high probability. If \\(p=0.95\\) then, based on the sampling distribution, there is a \\(95\\%\\) chance that the computed estimator will fall between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nNote that this interval, \\((a, b)\\) is not yet an interval for the true parameter; it is an interval for our estimator. However, it will almost always be the case that the endpoints of the interval, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), depend on the parameters of the sampling distribution. Recall that the sampling distribution’s parameters are connected to the population distributions parameters, and so we can view \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as depending directly on \\(\\theta\\). To emphasize this point, we write \\[P\\left(a(\\theta) \\leq \\widehat{\\theta} \\leq b(\\theta)\\right) = p.\\] It is important to remember that, in this expression, the only random quantity is \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\). However, we have an expression that we know will be true with high probability, that contains both \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\). We can exploit this to form confidence intervals.\nThe lower bound of our interval occurs where \\(a(\\theta) = \\widehat{\\theta}\\). Note that \\(a\\) is some function of \\(\\theta\\), and so we can think of the inverse function of \\(a\\), and apply it to both sides.3 That is, \\[a^{-1}(a(\\theta)) = a^{-1}(\\widehat{\\theta}) \\implies \\theta = a^{-1}(\\widehat{\\theta}).\\] Similarly, applying the same rationale with \\(b^{-1}\\) to the upper bound on the interval provides a secondary bound, \\(\\theta = b^{-1}(\\widehat{\\theta})\\).\n\nExample 14.1 (Car Washes for Charity) Charles and Sadie have decided that, to raise money for the local animal shelter, they will run a car wash. They recognize that the main cost in running the car wash is the water used for it, and that the key variable in terms of throughput of their cash wash is the time it takes for a car to be cleaned. They are trying to determine how to price and time their washes. Charles suggests that they should aim for using between \\(100\\) and \\(300\\) liters to wash a car, and Sadie notes that the amount of water being used is likely \\(5T + 10\\) liters, where \\(T\\) is the time in minutes.\nGiven this information, what is the equivalent interval for the time per car through their car wash?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we are told \\[100 \\leq 5T + 10 \\leq 300.\\] We can invert this interval to find an interval for \\(T\\) instead. Thus, we get \\(100 \\leq 5T + 10\\) which means \\(T \\geq 18\\). Similarly, \\(5T + 10 \\leq 300\\) means that \\(T \\leq 58\\). Thus, if the interval for water use is \\((100, 300)\\), then the interval for time will be \\((18, 58)\\) minutes.\n\n\n\n\nTaken together this means that whenever \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) falls in the interval with endpoints \\(a(\\theta)\\) and \\(b(\\theta)\\), it is equivalent to say that \\(\\theta\\) falls in the interval with end points \\(a^{-1}(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) and \\(b^{-1}(\\widehat{\\theta})\\).4 Thus, if we know that \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) falls between \\(a(\\theta)\\) and \\(b(\\theta)\\) with probability \\(p\\), this is mathematically equivalent to saying that \\(\\theta\\) falls between \\(a^{-1}(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) and \\(b^{-1}(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) with probability \\(p\\) as well. This inverted interval gives the confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\).\n\nDefinition 14.2 (Confidence Interval) A confidence interval for the parameter \\(\\theta\\) is an interval given by \\((L(\\widehat{\\theta}), U(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) such that \\[P(L(\\widehat{\\theta}) \\leq \\theta \\leq U(\\widehat{\\theta})) = p,\\] for some set level of \\(p\\). Often the confidence interval will be expressed in terms of \\(p=1-\\alpha\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is referred to as the level of significance. It is important to note that in this expression, \\(L(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) and \\(U(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) are random quantities, where \\(\\theta\\) is fixed. Correspondingly, the confidence probability can be written as \\[P(L(\\widehat{\\theta}) \\leq \\theta \\leq U(\\widehat{\\theta})) = P(L(\\widehat{\\theta}) \\leq \\theta,  U(\\widehat{\\theta}) \\geq \\theta) = p.\\]\n\nConceptually, a confidence interval provides an interval that, prior to conducting our estimation, we know there is a set threshold for the probability that the true parameter falls within its bounds. In our framing of the confidence intervals the random variables are \\(U(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) and \\(L(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) corresponding to \\(a^{-1}(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) and \\(b^{-1}(\\widehat{\\theta})\\). These can be viewed more generally as \\(U(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\) and \\(L(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\), being functions of the random sample. In this sense, both \\(U\\) and \\(L\\) are point estimators themselves. However, instead of estimating the parameter value directly, they are estimating upper and lower bounds for the parameter value. This is important to keep in mind since, fundamentally, it is the estimator that is random,5 not the parameter.\nIt is theoretically possible that there are many estimators, \\(U\\) and \\(L\\), that would satisfy the given probability statements. We generally need some manner of choosing which interval to use. The most important feature of any confidence interval is the length, which is to say \\(U(\\widehat{\\theta}) - L(\\widehat{\\theta})\\). All else equal, we prefer shorter intervals, since these give a more precise estimate of the true parameter value. We typically constrain our confidence interval definition to be such that \\(U(\\widehat{\\theta}) - L(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) is as small as possible, and select estimators that achieve this optimality.\n\nExample 14.2 (Charles Tufts a Rug) Charles has become very intrigued by tufting, making rugs using yarn, but is still learning, and has not fully calibrated the amount of yarn required for each project. For the size of rugs that Charles has been making, the internet states that the amount of yarn used per rug (measured in kg) can be thought of as coming from a \\(N(5, 1)\\) distribution.\nCharles wants to use this information to be confident in the average amount of yarn used, per rug, for the next \\(9\\) rugs made. With the help of Sadie, they determine three possible intervals:\n\n\\((4, 5)\\).\n\\((5, 6)\\).\n\\((4.77596, 5.22404)\\).\n\n\nWork out the approximate level of confidence that they should have in each interval. Note that \\(\\Phi(0.67212) \\approx 0.7492463\\).\nWhich of these intervals is the best to take as the basis of a confidence interval for Charles to use? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the next \\(9\\) rugs will have a sampling distribution given by \\(N(5, \\frac{1}{9})\\). We can compute the probability of each interval on this basis. Specifically, \\[P(4 \\leq \\overline{X} \\leq 5) = P(\\frac{4-5}{1/3} \\leq Z \\leq 0) = \\Phi(0) - \\Phi(-3).\\] Note that, using the empirical rule we know that this is going to be approximately \\(\\frac{0.997}{2} = 0.4985\\). The calculation for the second interval proceeds exactly the same way, giving \\(\\Phi(3) - \\Phi(0) \\approx 0.4985\\) by the empirical rule. For the third interval we take \\[\\begin{split}P(4.77596 \\leq \\overline{X} \\leq 5.22404) = P(\\frac{4.77596-5}{1/3} \\leq Z \\leq \\frac{5.22404-5}{1/3}) \\\\ = \\Phi(0.67212) - \\Phi(-0.67212).\\end{split}\\] From the question hint we have that \\(\\Phi(0.67212) \\approx 0.7492463\\), and \\(\\Phi(-0.67212) \\approx 1 - 0.7492463.\\) Thus, taken together the coverage of the third interval is \\[0.7492463 - (1 - 0.7492463) = 0.4984926 \\approx 0.4985.\\] All three intervals have the same coverage.\nThe third interval will be preferred. Each of the intervals gives the same coverage probabilities and the same level of confidence can be placed in all three of them. Thus, the main point of differentiation stems from the width of the intervals. The first two have a width of \\(1\\), whereas the third is \\(0.448\\) wide. This is less than half the width, with the same overall level of confidence. This will allow Charles to have a much more precise estimate of the amount of yarn used, without sacrificing the level of confidence in that estimate.",

    "section": "14.3 Interpretation of Confidence Intervals",
    "text": "14.3 Interpretation of Confidence Intervals\nThe construction of the confidence interval follows a fairly natural idea. We want an interval with a high probability of containing the truth, and so we start with an interval for our estimator and invert this to have an interval for the parameter. This procedure, while intuitive in construction, obscures the nuance in the probability statements that we can make. We must be very careful in the interpretation of a confidence interval.\nRecall that the random component in the interval is the endpoints, \\(U\\) and \\(L\\). These endpoints are estimators, and so the probability distribution associated with them is the sampling distribution of the estimators. Sampling distributions capture the behaviour of an estimator when we repeatedly draw samples and compute estimates on those samples. Thus, \\(P(L \\leq \\theta \\leq U) = p\\) means that, if we were to repeatedly draw samples from the population, use those samples to compute \\(L(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) and \\(U(\\widehat{\\theta})\\), and then check whether \\(L(\\widehat{\\theta}) \\leq \\theta \\leq U(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) holds, in the long-run \\(p\\) proportion of those runs would satisfy this condition. This is how we must interpret the confidence intervals.\nFormally, a \\(100p\\%\\) confidence interval interpreted by noting that, were this procedure to be repeated across many, many samples, the proportion of these samples that contain the true parameter will tend towards \\(p\\) as the number of samples tends towards \\(\\infty\\). Note that this is not a statement regarding any specific confidence interval, but rather, it is a statement regarding the procedure of constructing the confidence intervals.\nAs an alternative framing, we can consider applying the procedure in practice. Suppose that we have yet to take our sample, but we know that we will form the confidence interval as \\(\\left(L(\\widehat{\\theta}), U(\\widehat{\\theta})\\right)\\). Prior to observing any data, we know that this procedure will have a \\(p\\) probability of containing the true parameter, \\(\\theta\\). However, once we collect data and compute the values, we get \\(L(\\widehat{\\theta}) = \\ell\\) and \\(U(\\widehat{\\theta}) = u\\) for some fixed values \\(\\ell\\) and \\(u\\). Now, the statement \\(P(\\ell \\leq \\theta \\leq u)\\) is either equal to \\(1\\), if \\(\\ell \\leq \\theta \\leq u\\) holds, or it is equal to \\(0\\) otherwise. We do not know whether it is \\(0\\) or it is \\(1\\), but we do know that the probability is not \\(p\\).\n\nExample 14.3 (The Probability of Rolling a Six) Charles is working hard to truly understand the valid, and invalid, ways of interpreting confidence intervals. Sadie, who seems to have understood the concepts more thoroughly, is trying to help. Charles is particularly hung up on the idea that the process itself can be interpreted probabilistically, even when the specific interval that is formed cannot. Sadie, recognizing that this is the hang-up, works through the following thought experiment with Charles. Sadie asks the following questions.\n\nSuppose that I have a fair die in my hand. Before I have rolled it, what is the probability that the die shows a \\(6\\)?\nOnce the die is rolled, and the die is showing a \\(5\\), what is the probability that the die shows a \\(6\\)?\nIf instead, after the die were rolled, it showed a \\(6\\), what is the probability that the die shows a \\(6\\)?\nWhat can we say about the probability that the die shows a \\(6\\), in general, after it is rolled?\nHow does this relate to the confidence interval interpretation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the die is rolled, because it is a fair die, the probability it shows a \\(6\\) is \\(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\). This is precisely what we mean by the fact that the die is fair.\nIf the die is rolled and it shows a \\(5\\), the probability that it equals \\(6\\) is \\(0\\). That is, once it does not equal \\(6\\), we know for certain it is not \\(6\\).\nIf the die is rolled and it shows a \\(6\\), the probability that it equals \\(6\\) is \\(1\\). That is, once it does equal \\(6\\), we know for certain that it is \\(6\\).\nAfter the die is rolled, the probability will be either \\(0\\) or it will be \\(1\\), depending on whether it was a \\(6\\) or not. We do not know until we have observed it whether it is \\(0\\) or it is \\(1\\), but necessarily one of those probabilities is the truth.\nIn a confidence interval, the probability is not attributed to the specific interval, but rather to the process. Relating to the die example, the specific realization that is shown after the die is rolled is analogous to the specific interval. We know that depending on whether we see a \\(6\\) or it is not the probability is \\(1\\) or \\(0\\). Similarly, once computed, a specific interval has either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) probability of containing the truth. Still, the process through which the interval was formed produces a predictable probability of forming intervals with the true value, just as the process of rolling the die produces predictable probabilities of showing \\(6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe confidence threshold in a confidence interval relates to the procedure, not to any specific interval produced by that procedure. That is, we can put our confidence in constructing intervals in this way knowing that, if we always follow this procedure, over time our intervals will be correct in a specific proportion of cases. However, we cannot use this to make claims about any specific confidence interval. We do not know in any given sample whether the interval is one that contains the truth, or one that does not. In fact, we cannot know this, without learning what the true parameter value is.\nThis makes confidence intervals clunky to interpret. Notably, the interpretation of a confidence interval never makes reference to the specific interval that we have computed. Instead, the interpretation of the confidence interval gives a description of the procedure that created the interval, and ascribes a level of confidence to this underlying procedure.6\nFurther misconceptions of confidence intervals commonly occur. For instance, individuals will commonly interpret a confidence interval to mean that \\(p\\) proportion of the sample data lie within the interval. This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the confidence interval is a statement regarding an estimator or parameter value, rather than the sample value itself. From the same sample you can calculate different confidence intervals for different parameters.7 Second, this interpretation further relies on the thought that a confidence interval is interpreted specific to a particular sample. This is not the case.\nAlternatively, individuals may misinterpret a confidence interval as stating that, were we to repeatedly sample from the population and compute the estimator, in \\(p\\) proportion of these trials the estimated value will be contained in the interval we have computed. This misinterpretation is appealing as it seems to use the repeated draws from the population. However, note two concerns. First, this interpretation also relies on giving interpretation to the specific interval that we have computed, which the correct interpretation cannot. Second, this interpretation makes a probability statement regarding the estimator, rather than the parameter (or the endpoints of the interval). Remember that \\(U\\) and \\(L\\) are the random components, and they are calibrated such that \\(P(L \\leq \\theta \\leq U) = p\\). This is not a probability statement relating to where the estimate is likely to show up, rather one regarding the true value.\n\nExample 14.4 (Bird Watching Confidence) Sadie and Charles have continued their bird watching adventures. As their statistical knowledge has expanded, they have continued to integrate this new found knowledge into their trips. Lately, they have begun to consider confidence intervals, and so with a little help from their friend Garth, they work out the confidence interval for the average number of rare birds at a particular location that they enjoy traveling to. They find that the \\(90\\%\\) confidence interval is given by \\((1.4, 8.5)\\). Seeing as confidence intervals are still new to them, they start trying to work out the interpretation of this statement together. Help them out by answering their questions, with explanations.\n\nCharles wonders, “Does this mean that, if we go, there is a \\(90\\%\\) chance we will see between \\(1.4\\) and \\(8.5\\) rare birds?”\nSadie responds, questioning “Perhaps it means that, if we go many, many, many times, in \\(90\\%\\) of cases we will see in this range?”\nCharles questions, “Could it mean that, from the sample data we have collected, \\(90\\%\\) of observations fall between \\(1.4\\) and \\(8.5\\)?”\nSadie follows up, “Or that, if we were to perform the sampling many times, and calculate the sample average for each of those, then \\(90\\%\\) of sample averages should fall between \\(1.4\\) and \\(8.5\\)?”\nWhat does it actually mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis does not mean that there is a \\(90\\%\\) chance we will see between \\(1.4\\) and \\(8.5\\) birds. The concern here is that we cannot apply the interpretation to any specific interval. Instead, we need to be thinking about the procedure generating the interval. There is a \\(90\\%\\) chance that the procedure generates an interval that is valid, but we cannot know about any specific interval we are looking at.\nThis statement is just a rephrasing of Charles’ first statement. To have a \\(90\\%\\) chance of seeing between \\(1.4\\) and \\(8.5\\) rare birds is to say that, if you observe birds many, many times, then in \\(90\\%\\) of those cases you observe in that range. It is an incorrect interpretation for the same reason as above.\nNo. Confidence intervals are never making comments about what has been observed in the sample, they are instead designed to be inferential about the population at large. We are not capturing information about past samples. The other important note is that, this is a confidence interval for the mean, not for the observations themselves.\nAgain, this is a tempting misinterpretation. Here, Sadie has the correct idea of repeatedly performing experiments, however, the idea is not that in repeated experiments the current interval will contain the sample mean. Rather, in repeated experiments, the computed interval will contain the true mean. That is, once again, we need to focus on the population mean not the sample values, and we need to focus on the procedure, not the specific interval.\nThis confidence interval is not interpreted on its own. However, we can say that, were we to continue to make observations and use these observations to compute confidence intervals, following the exact same procedure, in \\(90\\%\\) of those cases we would find an interval that contains the truth. We can also say, practically, that there is a fair amount of variability in the number of birds that are likely to be seen, and so Charles and Sadie should likely prepare themselves for the possibility of wide swings between different trips. An alternative way of interpreting the interval is to note that, before any data were analyzed, the probability that they would calculate an interval containing the truth was \\(0.9\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, the utility of reporting a confidence interval is that it conveys a sense of uncertainty. Wider intervals suggest that we should put less assurance in the value of the point estimate than more narrow intervals. Moreover, given a confidence interval, there is little reason to think that one value in this interval is more likely to correspond to the truth than any other value. We can use the intervals to determine whether decisions that are made on the basis of estimation would be made under all scenarios implied by the interval. If conclusions differ assuming that \\(\\theta = U\\) compared to \\(\\theta = L\\), care should be put into making more conservative decisions, since based on the sample there is little reason to differentiate between these points.",

    "text": "14.4 Confidence Intervals for the Mean\nWhile confidence intervals can be derived for any parameter of interest, as previously discussed, we are very commonly interested in the means of populations. Moreover, owing to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of a sample mean is often easy to approximate. We will primarily focus on confidence intervals for the means of distribution. We differentiate the procedure based on whether the population is itself normally distributed or not.\n\n14.4.1 Confidence Intervals in Normal Populations\nIf our population is normally distributed then the sample mean is known to be exactly normally distributed as well. The sampling distribution depends on both the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), as well as on the population variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Suppose that we wanted to determine \\(P(a \\leq \\overline{X} \\leq b)\\), for some values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then we know that \\[P(a \\leq \\overline{X} \\leq b) = P\\left(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\leq Z \\leq \\frac{b - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{b - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right) - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right).\\]\nIf \\(\\sigma^2\\) is known then we can use the percentiles of the standard normal distribution to solve for what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would have to be. Specifically, if we take the two end points to be symmetric, then we want to solve for \\[\\Phi\\left(\\frac{b - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{1-p}{2},\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\Phi\\left(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = \\frac{1-p}{2}.\\] If we did this then we would find that \\[P(a \\leq \\overline{X} \\leq b) = 1 - \\frac{1-p}{2} - \\frac{1-p}{2} = p,\\] as desired.\nTo solve for these quantities, we note that these are exactly the quantiles of the standard normal distribution. That is, \\[\\begin{align*}\\Phi\\left(\\frac{b - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right) &= 1 - \\frac{1-p}{2} \\implies \\frac{b - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} = Z_{1 - \\frac{1-p}{2}}, \\\\\n\\Phi\\left(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right) &= \\frac{1-p}{2} \\implies \\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} = Z_{\\frac{1-p}{2}}.\\end{align*}\\] Note that, by symmetry, \\(Z_{(1-p)/2} = -Z_{1 - (1-p)/2}\\), so we take \\[Z_{(1-p)/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} + \\mu \\leq \\overline{X} \\leq Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} + \\mu.\\] This interval can then be inverted to give an interval for \\(\\mu\\). Namely, \\[\\begin{align*}\nZ_{(1-p)/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} + \\mu &\\leq \\overline{X} \\\\\n\\implies \\mu &\\leq \\overline{X} - Z_{(1-p)/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\\\\n&= \\overline{X} + Z_{1 - (1-p)/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\\\\n\\overline{X} \\leq Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} + \\mu \\\\\n\\implies \\overline{X} - \\leq Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} &\\leq \\mu.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThese two bounds give rise to the confidence intervals for the mean of a normal population, when \\(\\sigma\\) is known.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals for the Mean (Known \\(\\sigma\\) in a Normal Population)\n\n\n\nIf a population is known to be normally distributed, with a known population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), then a \\(100p\\%\\) confidence interval for the mean is given by \\[(\\overline{X} - \\leq Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\overline{X} + Z_{1 - (1-p)/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}).\\] This is often expressed as \\[\\overline{X} \\pm Z_{(1-p)/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Normal Critical Values\n\n\n\nWhen introducing the normal distribution, we discussed the percentiles of the normal as normal critical values. We discussed how these can be found using the qnorm function in R. In most introductory statistics references, they will contain tables of normal critical values, giving the mappings between the \\(Z\\) values and their probabilities. The following are commonly used \\(Z\\) values, provided for reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\\(Z_{\\alpha}\\)\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\\(Z_{\\alpha}\\)\n\n\n\n\n0.005\n-2.58\n0.995\n2.58\n\n\n0.010\n-2.33\n0.990\n2.33\n\n\n0.025\n-1.96\n0.975\n1.96\n\n\n0.050\n-1.64\n0.950\n1.64\n\n\n0.100\n-1.28\n0.900\n1.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.5 (Charle’s Nap Times) Charles is a frequent napper. Sadie, on the other hand, cannot take naps at all. Sadie often has a significant amount of boredom while Charles naps away, and so Sadie starts to record the length of the naps that Charles takes, in minutes. Over the last \\(5\\) days, Charles’ naps have been: \\[33.2, \\ 29.6, \\ 29.7, \\ 31.7, \\ 29.1.\\]\n\nWhat is an estimate for the average length of Charles’ naps?\nSadie assumes that Charles’ naps are normally distributed, with a variance of \\(4\\). Find a \\(90\\%\\) confidence interval for the average nap length.\nUsing the same assumptions, find a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for the average nap length.\nHow would an \\(80\\%\\) confidence interval compare? A \\(99.9\\%\\) interval? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the sample average to estimate the population average. This is given by \\[\\frac{1}{5}\\left(33.2 + 29.6 + 29.7 + 31.7 + 29.1\\right) = 30.66\\]\nAssuming normality and with known variance, we can take \\[\\overline{X} \\pm Z_{(1-p)/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\] Here, \\(\\sigma = 2\\), \\(\\sqrt{n} = \\sqrt{5}\\), \\(\\overline{X} = 30.66\\). For a \\(90\\%\\) confidence interval, we have \\((1 - 0.9) / 2 = 0.05\\), and thus \\(Z_{(1-p)/2} = -1.64\\). We get \\[30.66 \\pm 1.64\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} = (29.19, 32.13).\\]\nFor a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval, we change the critical value to be given by \\(Z_{(1-0.95)/2} = -1.96\\). Thus, \\[30.66 \\pm 1.96\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} = (28.91, 32.41).\\]\nAs the confidence level increases, the width of the confidence level must also increase. Thus, we should find that an \\(80\\%\\) confidence interval is more tightly centered around \\(30.66\\) and a \\(99.9\\%\\) confidence interval is more widely spread out. Indeed, using R we can find these to be \\((29.51, 31.81)\\) for the \\(80\\%\\) interval, and \\((27.72, 33.6)\\) for the \\(99.9\\%\\) interval.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the variance is not known, then this procedure cannot be followed directly. An obvious alteration to make is to substitute \\(s^2\\) for \\(\\sigma^2\\) in the expression for the confidence interval. However, if we consider the quantity \\[\\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu}{s/\\sqrt{n}},\\] this will no longer follow a normal distribution. Instead, assuming that \\(\\overline{X}\\) is normally distributed, this ratio follows a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. Otherwise, the same procedure can be followed, this time needing the critical values from the \\(t_{n-1}\\) distribution rather than the standard normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals for the Mean (Unknown \\(\\sigma\\) in a Normal Population)\n\n\n\nIf a population is known to be normally distributed, with an unknown population standard deviation, then a \\(100p\\%\\) confidence interval for the mean is given by \\[(\\overline{X} - \\leq t_{n-1, 1-(1-p)/2}\\dfrac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\overline{X} + t_{n-1, 1 - (1-p)/2}\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}).\\] This is often expressed as \\[\\overline{X} \\pm t_{n-1, (1-p)/2}\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\]\n\n\n\nExample 14.6 (Charle’s Continues Napping) Charles has maintained the pattern of daily naps. Sadie, understanding more about confidence intervals, decides to revisit the intervals for the length of Charles’ naps. This time, instead of assuming that the variance is known to be \\(4\\), Sadie wants to leverage the same data as was used to find the mean. Specifically, Sadie has recorded that over a \\(5\\) day stretch, the length of Charles’ naps have been: \\[33.2, \\ 29.6, \\ 29.7, \\ 31.7, \\ 29.1.\\] While Sadie does not want to presume that the variance is known, for now, the assumption of normality still feels reasonable.\n\nWhat is the sample variance?\nUsing the sample variance, how could Sadie construct a \\(90\\%\\) confidence interval for the mean?\nWhat critical value would need to be used to calculate a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval in this case? A \\(99\\%\\) one?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the sample variance, we calculate \\[\\begin{split}\\frac{1}{5-1}\\left((33.2 - 30.66)^2 + (29.6-30.66)^2 + (29.7 - 30.66)^2 \\right.\\\\\n\\left. + (31.7 - 30.66)^2 + (29.1 - 30.66)^2\\right) = 3.003.\\end{split}\\]\nSince the population is normally distributed, with an unknown variance, Sadie can use the form \\[\\overline{X} \\pm t_{n-1,(1-p)/2}\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}},\\] to form confidence intervals. Here, \\(\\overline{X} = 30.66\\), \\(n = 5\\), \\(s = \\sqrt{3.003}\\), and \\(p=0.9\\). Thus, the critical value to use is the \\(t_{4, 0.05}\\) value, and the form of the interval will be \\[30.66 \\pm t_{4, 0.05}\\sqrt{\\frac{3.003}{5}} = 30.66 \\pm t_{4, 0.05}\\sqrt{0.6006}.\\] Using R, we can call qt(0.05, 4) to determine that the critical value is approximately -2.13, to fill in for the specific value of \\(t_{4, 0.05}\\).\nHere we would still reference the \\(t\\) distribution with \\(4\\) degrees of freedom, but now instead of the \\(0.05\\) percentile, we would need to look at either the \\(0.025\\) or \\(0.005\\) percentiles. This would give, \\(t_{4, 0.025} \\approx -2.78\\) and \\(t_{4, 0.005} \\approx -4.6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both scenarios, the confidence interval forms a symmetric interval around the estimated mean, \\(\\overline{X}\\), and is based on critical values from the relevant sampling distribution. If \\(n\\) is sufficiently large than \\(t_{n-1, \\alpha} \\approx Z_{\\alpha}\\), and so in these cases it is sometimes acceptable to use the \\(Z\\)-based intervals, as though \\(\\sigma\\) were known. These intervals are justified on the basis of the population being normally distributed. What if this is not an assumption we can make?\n\n\n14.4.2 Confidence Intervals in Non-Normal Populations\nWhen populations are non-normal, there are two possible techniques for forming confidence intervals for the mean. In the first, we can attempt to use the assumed population distribution to derive an exact confidence interval for the mean, based on the true sampling distribution. This would need to be worked out for every individual population distribution, and would be valid only for that distribution. Alternatively, if our sample sizes are large enough, then we can use the Central Limit Theorem to indicate that \\(\\overline{X}\\) will be approximately normally distributed. In this case, we can follow the same procedures outlined above. Note that doing so will not give exact confidence intervals, instead settling for approximate confidence intervals. These are often reliable enough in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximate Confidence Intervals for the Mean\n\n\n\nFor a sufficiently large sample size, such that Central Limit Theorem applies, a a \\(100p\\%\\) confidence interval for the mean is given by \\[(\\overline{X} - \\leq t_{n-1, 1-(1-p)/2}\\dfrac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\overline{X} + t_{n-1, 1 - (1-p)/2}\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}).\\] This is often expressed as \\[\\overline{X} \\pm t_{n-1, (1-p)/2}\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\]\n\n\n\nExample 14.7 (Charles’ Naps are Not Normal) Sadie realizes that the assumption that Charles’ nap lengths are normally distributed may not be correct, and begins to wonder how this may impact the calculations that have been done before. Recall that previously Sadie had recorded \\(5\\) nap lengths for Charles, giving \\[33.2, \\ 29.6, \\ 29.7, \\ 31.7, \\ 29.1.\\]\n\nCan Sadie use these data, assuming that they are not normal, to compute a confidence interval for the mean length of Charles’ naps? Explain.\nSuppose that Sadie records data over two months, giving \\(n=60\\). Over this time, the mean nap length is \\(31.10\\) and the standard deviation is \\(8.61\\). How may Sadie use this information to construct a \\(100p\\%\\) confidence interval for the length of the nap.\nGiven that \\(n\\) is fairly large, what will be the approximate value of the critical value needed for a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval. Use this to write down an approximate \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. The issue is that, without normality, we rely on the Central Limit Theorem to form the confidence intervals. However, in order for the CLT to apply, we must have a large enough sample. A sample of size \\(5\\) is not going to be large enough to invoke the CLT, and as a result, we either need to make other assumptions about the population, or else collect more data.\nIn this case, we can use the CLT to form the confidence interval. Namely we get \\[\\overline{X} \\pm t_{n-1, (1-p)/2}\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = 31.10 \\pm t_{59, (1-p)/2}\\frac{8.61}{\\sqrt{60}}.\\] Here the critical values come from the \\(t_{59}\\) distribution, and could be computed for any level of interest.\nWhen \\(n\\) is large, we get that \\(t_{n, \\alpha} \\approx Z_{\\alpha}\\). Because of this, we can take the critical value to be approximately \\(Z_{0.025} = -1.96\\).8 Using this value we get \\[31.10 \\pm 1.96\\frac{8.61}{\\sqrt{60}} = (30.92, 35.28).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe previously discussed how, in the event of having data from a binomial experiment, we can view the estimator of the success probability, \\(\\widehat{p}\\) as a sample mean. This means that, supposing that we wish to find a confidence interval for a proportion, we can follow fundamentally the same procedure. A key distinction here is that, in the case of binomial data, the estimated variance is not \\(s^2\\) but rather \\(n\\widehat{p}(1 - \\widehat{p})\\). Practically, this means that we can use the standard normal critical values for our confidence intervals, rather than the \\(t\\) values.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximate Confidence Intervals for a Proportion\n\n\n\nFor a sufficiently large sample size, such that Central Limit Theorem applies, a a \\(100p\\%\\) confidence interval for a proportion is given by \\[(\\widehat{p} - Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}, \\overline{X} + Z_{1 - (1-p)/2}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}).\\] This is often expressed as \\[\\widehat{p} \\pm Z_{(1-p)/2}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}.\\]",

    "section": "14.5 Confidence Intervals for the Variance",
    "text": "14.5 Confidence Intervals for the Variance\nIt is important to recognize that, while the formulae for confidence intervals for the means are used frequently, the process of forming a confidence interval is equivalent regardless of the parameter that is under consideration. Generally, a confidence interval can be found by first finding an interval around the estimator, and then inverting this interval to form one around the parameter value. The key step in this process is determining the sampling distribution for the relevant statistic. As such, when learning confidence intervals, it is best to focus on the overarching procedure and understand where each formula is coming from, rather than specifically pattern matching to find which formula to use. When considering the mean, we use the \\(Z\\) or \\(t\\) critical values depending on whether the sampling distribution follows a normal or a \\(t\\) distribution. Recognizing this enables confidence intervals for any parameters for which the sampling distribution is known.\nAs an example of how this procedure can be applied, consider taking a normal population, and forming a confidence interval for the variance. In order to do so, we would first want to find an interval around \\(S^2\\) that would hold with probability \\(p\\), and then invert this interval. This relies on knowledge of the sampling distribution of \\(S^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sampling Distribution of \\(S^2\\)\n\n\n\nIf the population is normally distributed, with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), then the sampling distribution of \\[S^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2,\\] can be derived by noting that \\[\\frac{(n-1)}{\\sigma^2}S^2 \\sim \\chi^2_{n-1}.\\] This is, notably, not precisely the sampling distribution of \\(S^2\\) directly, however, it can be manipulated to give probability statements regarding \\(S^2\\).\n\n\nUsing this result, we can then form a confidence interval for \\(S^2\\). We start by finding constants, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), such that \\[P(a \\leq S^2 \\leq b) = p \\implies P\\left(\\frac{(n-1)a}{\\sigma^2} \\leq \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\sigma^2} \\leq \\frac{(n-1)b}{\\sigma^2}\\right) = p.\\] Noting the sampling distribution, we require \\[\\frac{(n-1)a}{\\sigma^2} = \\chi^2_{n-1,(1-p)/2} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{(n-1)b}{\\sigma^2} = \\chi^2_{n-1,1-(1-p)/2}.\\] Unlike the normal distribution, the chi-squared distribution is not symmetric, and the critical values will not be equal in magnitude. We can take this interval for \\(S^2\\), and solve it for \\(\\sigma^2\\) instead. Doing so gives \\[\\chi^2_{n-1,(1-p)/2} \\leq \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\sigma^2} \\implies \\sigma^2 \\leq \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\chi^2_{n-1,(1-p)/2}} = U(S^2),\\] as the upper bound on the confidence interval, and \\[\\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\sigma^2} \\leq \\chi^2_{n-1,1-(1-p)/2} \\implies L(S^2) = \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\chi^2_{n-1,1-(1-p)/2}} \\leq \\sigma^2,\\] as the lower bound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals for the Sample Variance\n\n\n\nFor a normally distributed population, a confidence interval for the variance is formed by taking \\[\\left(\\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\chi^2_{n-1,1-(1-p)/2}}, \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\chi^2_{n-1,(1-p)/2}}\\right).\\] Here, the critical values from the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution are given by the \\(1-(1-p)/2\\) and \\((1-p)/2\\) quantiles, respectively. This is sometimes expressed using a different definition for the critical values.\n\n\nNote that this derivation follows directly from knowledge of the sampling distribution of \\(S^2\\). Had we been given a different result, we could have worked through the same procedure, resulting in different interval formula with the same underlying process. This specific result importantly relies on the assumption that the population is normally distributed. Were we in a situation where this is not the case, the formula do not hold, regardless of the size of the sample. To find confidence intervals for sample variances in non-normal populations, we require results regarding their sampling distributions.\nIt is also worth considering how we may use this result to form confidence intervals for standard deviations. Generally speaking, confidence intervals are not invariant to transformations. By this we mean that, even though \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\\), taking the confidence interval \\((\\sqrt{L(S^2)}, \\sqrt{U(S^2)})\\) will not result in an exact confidence interval for \\(\\sigma\\). Despite the fact that this will not generally be exactly correct, this is the procedure we tend to use. That is, if we have a confidence interval for a parameter, \\(\\theta\\), given by \\[(L(\\widehat{\\theta}), U(\\widehat{\\theta})),\\] and we wish to have a confidence interval for some transformation, \\(g(\\theta)\\), we will typically use \\[\\left(g(L(\\widehat{\\theta})), g(U(\\widehat{\\theta}))\\right).\\] As long as \\(g\\) is a nicely behaved function, this will typically result in an acceptably close approximation.10 Supposing that we have a confidence interval for \\(\\sigma^2\\), then we can form a confidence interval for \\(\\sigma\\) simply by taking the square root of the end points.\n\nExample 14.8 (Charles’ Tufting Supplier Variability) Charles has been continuing to learn to tuft. One issue that has been coming up is in the variability of the durability of the yarn across different batches from the same supplier. Charles has found that it is important to approximately match the tensile strength of yarns on the same rug, otherwise it can lead to suboptimal results. Curious about how much variability there truly is in the tensile strength from the main supplier, Charles takes the following measurements: \\[20.29, 14.78, 13.9, 15.5, 20.05, 14.72.\\]\n\nWhat is the estimated variance of the yarn strength from this supplier?\nHow can Charles use this information to form a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for the strength of the yarn?\nSupposing that a confidence interval is found for the variance as \\((3.24, 49.0)\\), what is a confidence interval for the standard deviation? Is this exact? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the sample variance, we first need to get the sample mean. This is given by \\[\\frac{1}{6}\\left(20.29 + 14.78 + 13.9 + 15.5 + 20.05 + 14.72\\right) = 16.54.\\] Then, we take \\[\\begin{split}\\frac{1}{6-1}\\left((20.29 - 16.54)^2 + (14.78 - 16.54)^2 + (13.9 - 16.54)^2 \\right. \\\\ \\left. + (15.5 - 16.54)^2 + (20.05 - 16.54)^2\\right) = 8.16876.\\end{split}\\]\nTo form the confidence interval in this setting we note that, assuming the observations are normally distributed, then the scaled sample mean will follow a \\(\\chi^2_{n-1}\\) distribution, where \\(n=6\\). Thus, we take \\[\\left(\\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\chi^2_{n-1,1-(1-p)/2}}, \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\chi^2_{n-1,(1-p)/2}}\\right)\\] where \\(s^2 = 8.16876\\), \\(n=6\\), and \\(p=0.95\\). Plugging in, this gives \\[\\left(\\frac{(5)(8.16876)}{\\chi^2_{5,0.975}}, \\frac{(5)(8.16876)}{\\chi^2_{5,0.025}}\\right).\\] If we use R to compute the critical values, this gives \\((3.1828399, 49.1376676)\\).\nGiven the interval \\((3.24, 49.0)\\), we can approximate a confidence interval for the standard deviation by square rooting the end points. This gives \\((1.8, 7)\\). This is not exact, since confidence intervals are not typically invariant to transformations. Instead, this will be approximate, but will typically be close enough in practice.",

    "section": "14.6 Margin of Error and Sample Sizing",
    "text": "14.6 Margin of Error and Sample Sizing\nWhen communicating the results of a scientific study, it is typically considered best practice to report confidence intervals alongside point estimates. This conveys the uncertainty in the estimate, and it gives the individual consuming the results the ability to make decisions based on the sensitivity of these results to the reported values. Knowing that you are likely to report a confidence interval, you can use the form of the confidence interval to make planning decisions regarding the study.\nWhen forming confidence intervals for the mean, all of the intervals we considered took the form \\(\\overline{X} \\pm \\Omega\\), where \\(\\Omega\\) depended on the underlying variability, the sampling distribution, the degree of confidence, as well as the sample size. We call this term, the margin of error.\n\nDefinition 14.3 (Margin of Error) In a symmetric confidence interval, the margin of error is defined to be the distance from the point estimate to the upper or lower confidence bounds. That is, a confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\) can be expressed as \\[\\widehat{\\theta} \\pm \\text{M.E.}(\\widehat{\\theta}),\\] where \\(\\text{M.E}(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) corresponds to the margin of error. The width of a confidence interval is always \\(2\\times\\text{M.E.}\\).\n\nAs noted previously, all else equal we would prefer a confidence interval that is less wide. This is equivalent to saying that we prefer a smaller margin of error. We can consider how the various choices that we make may influence the overall width of the confidence interval. Consider a normal population, with known variance. In this setting \\[\\text{M.E.}(\\overline{X}) = Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\] The three components of this formula are \\(p\\), \\(\\sigma\\), and \\(n\\). Note that, as \\(p\\) increases, \\(1-(1-p)/2\\) also increases, and so \\(Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\\) will also increase. This means that if we want a higher \\(p\\), the confidence interval must get wider.11 Similarly, if \\(\\sigma\\) is larger, then the confidence interval will also be wider. This is not under control of the researcher, but it is to say that in more varied populations, confidence intervals will tend to be wider.12 Finally, we see that as \\(n\\) increases, the width of the confidence interval will decrease. This is a choice that the researcher gets to make.\nNoting that as the sample size increases the width of the confidence interval decreases, we can use this relationship to decide what sample size our study should rely on. Specifically, if a researcher knows the variance (or has an estimated value for the sample variance), then they can determine what \\(n\\) is required in order to achieve a set margin of error. For instance, perhaps you want to have a \\(99\\%\\) confidence interval that will give a margin of error of no more than \\(0.01\\). By setting the margin of error equal to \\(0.01\\), and taking \\(p = 0.99\\), you can determine that \\[n \\geq \\left(Z_{0.995}\\frac{\\sigma}{0.01}\\right)^2.\\] As long as the value for \\(\\sigma\\) is correct, this will guarantee the desired result.\n\nExample 14.9 (Tensile Strength Averages) Charles has been continuing to deal with high variability in the tensile strength of the main yarn supplier. There is another possible supplier to use, however, Charles wants to be very sure that the average tensile strength of the new supplier’s yarn is acceptable as well. Charles will be happy if a \\(90\\%\\) confidence interval is within \\(0.1\\) of the true average tensile strength. From experience and word-of-mouth, Charles suspects that the new supplier has a tensile strength variability of approximately \\(4\\).\n\nHow many balls of yarn should Charles buy in order to form the desired confidence interval?\nWhat if Charles were content with being within \\(1\\) of the true average?\nSuppose that instead of estimating the average, Charles wants to estimate the proportion of balls of yarn from the new supplier with a strength that exceeds that of the old supplier. To do so, Charles buys pairs of balls of yarn, and compares the strength of each of them, reporting whether the new supplier is higher or lower. Approximately how many pairs of balls of yarn would be required so that the proportion can be estimated to within \\(0.01\\) of the true proportion, with \\(95\\%\\) confidence?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, Charles wants a margin of error equal to \\(0.1\\). We know that, in this case, the approximate value for the margin of error will be \\[Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = 1.64\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\] Thus, we solve \\[\\begin{align*}\n1.64\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}} &\\leq 0.1 \\\\\n\\frac{3.28}{0.1} \\leq \\sqrt{n} \\\\\n32.8^2 \\leq n \\\\\n1075.84 \\leq n.\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, Charles would need to buy at least \\(1076\\) balls of yarn to have the level of confidence desired in the tensile strength.\nTo be within \\(1\\), we solve the same expression as in (a) but for a margin of error of \\(1\\). This results in \\(n \\geq 3.28^2 = 10.8\\), and so in this case Charles would need to purchase \\(11\\) balls of yarn.\nHere, we wish to estimate a proportion within \\(0.01\\) of the truth. To do so, recognize that we can take the normal approximation for the confidence interval, which gives a margin of error equal to \\[Z_{1-(1-p)/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}.\\] In principle, we can solve for this equal to \\(0.01\\). However, it is important to note that we should take a conservative approach to \\(p\\) here. The most variability will come when \\(p=0.5\\), and so we should estimate the population variance to be based on \\(p=0.5\\). This gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nZ_{0.975}\\sqrt{\\frac{0.5^2}{n}} &\\leq 0.01 \\\\\n\\frac{1.96(0.5)}{0.01} &\\leq \\sqrt{n} \\\\\n9.8^2 &\\leq n \\\\\n96.04 \\leq n.\n\\end{align*}\\] There should be at least \\(97\\) pairs of balls of yarn purchased to have this degree of confidence in the proportion estimate.",

    "text": "15.1 The Framework of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing\nOver the past two chapters the focus has been on estimation procedures for parameters of interest. Point estimation gives us methods to make inferences regarding the specific value of a particular parameter, while interval estimation permits the discussion of the uncertainty of these estimates. Taken together these estimation techniques allow for a deep understanding of the value of parameters, based on observed samples. We know that every sample we take is likely to result in different estimates based on sampling variability. Correspondingly, the specific inferences that are made regarding the parameter values will depend on the specific sample that is observed. Using interval estimates we hope to capture how uncertain our knowledge is, however, it is an unavoidable truth that any conclusions we draw are subject to the whims of the sample. A fundamental question we can ask, in light of this truth, is “how are we able to draw specific conclusions or make decisions on the basis of our estimated values?”\nThe framework of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), often referred to as simply hypothesis testing, provides one mechanism for making decisions regarding the value(s) of parameter(s) using observed samples. In a hypothesis test the observed sample is used to weigh evidence against competing explanations for what is true in the population. We make educated guesses regarding the likely value of a population parameter and then determine how likely it would be to observe the sample that we have actually observed, if our guesses are actually true. If the sample is likely to be produced under our specified version of truth, then the sample provides no evidence against the guesses. If, on the other hand, the sample is unlikely given our specified version of the truth, this serves as evidence against our guesses.\nAt the core of the hypothesis testing framework is the idea of a statistical hypothesis. A statistical hypothesis is a specification of a plausible parameter value made on the basis of subject-matter expertise, rather than through the data themselves. Alongside the statistical hypothesis, subject-matter expertise is required to define the evidentiary requirements of the test. Specifically, we must consider how certain we want be regarding conclusions that we draw, a decision that is ultimately based on the stakes of drawing an incorrect conclusion. With the specification of a hypothesis and a required level of significance, we turn to the data that have been observed and summarize them using a test statistic. A test statistic is a statistic that has a known sampling distribution under the assumption that our hypothesis is correct. Using this test statistic, and the knowledge of its sampling distribution, we can assess the likelihood of having observed this specific statistic if the hypothesis were true. Based on our assessment, and the level of significance we desire, we can then draw conclusions and interpret the results.\nThis high-level description summarizes the procedure of hypothesis testing as a five-step procedure:\nEach of these steps is outlined in general in the following sections.",

    "text": "Example 15.1 (Sadie and the Weighted Die) Sadie has been playing a board game that was borrowed from Garth, and has been feeling particularly unlucky based on dice rolls. Uncertain if the die provided in the game is actually fair, Sadie decides to test it. Specifically, in the game it benefits the player to roll high numbers and is a detriment to rolling low numbers. Sadie decides to roll the die many times, recording whether each roll is high (greater than or equal to \\(3\\)) or low (less than or equal to \\(3\\)).\n\nSuppose Sadie rolls the die \\(50\\) times and observes \\(21\\) high values and \\(29\\) low values. If the die were fair, approximately how likely is it that \\(21\\) or fewer high values would be rolled in \\(50\\) rolls?\nSuppose Sadie continues rolling, and in \\(100\\) rolls of the die, observes \\(35\\) high values and \\(65\\) low values. If the die were fair, approximately how likely is it that \\(35\\) or fewer high values would be rolled in \\(100\\) rolls?\nIn light of these probabilities, what is your conclusion about the die?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the die were actually fair, then we know the number of high values should follow a \\(\\text{Bin}(50, 0.5)\\). Thus, we want \\(P(X \\leq 21)\\). We can compute this directly from the binomial (for instance, using R), which would given 0.161. Alternatively, we can use the normal approximation to the binomial. In this case, we would find that \\(X\\) share an approximate distribution with \\(W \\sim N(25, 12.5)\\), and \\(P(X \\leq 21) \\approx P(W \\leq 21.5)\\). Then, \\[P(W \\leq 21.5) = P(Z \\leq \\frac{21.5-25}{\\sqrt{12.5}}) = \\Phi(-0.99) \\approx \\Phi(-1).\\] This can be approximated via the empirical rule as \\[1 - (0.5 + \\frac{0.68}{2}) = 0.16,\\] which is near the value calculated directly from the binomial. Thus, there is about a \\(16\\%\\) chance that the die would produce this few high numbers, if it were fair.\nUsing the exact same procedure as above, we get \\(X \\sim \\text{Bin}(100, 0.5)\\) approximated by \\(W \\sim N(50, 25)\\). This gives either a direct binomial probability of approximately 0.002. For the approximation, we get \\[P(W \\leq 35.5) = P(Z \\leq \\frac{35.5 - 50}{5}) = \\Phi(-2.9) \\approx \\Phi(-3).\\] This is, from the empirical rule, approximately \\[1 - (0.5 + \\frac{0.997}{2}) = 0.0015.\\]\nBased on the \\(100\\) rolls of the die, it seems very unlikely that the die is actually fair. Sadie could be getting very unlucky, however, if the die is fair there is about a \\(1\\) in \\(1000\\) chance that this few high rolls would be seen. Thus, it is more reasonable to assume that the die is not actually fair than it is to assume that Sadie has just been very unlucky. The evidence after \\(50\\) rolls is far less strong, being approximately \\(1\\) in \\(5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 15.1 (Hypothesis Testing) Hypothesis testing is a statistical framework through which data are assessed to determine whether they sufficiently support a particular hypothesis regarding a population parameter. Under an assumed hypothesis regarding the true population parameter, the likelihood of observing the present sample is computed. From this conclusions are drawn with regards to the statistical validity of the hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the null and alternative hypotheses.\nDetermine the significance level for the test.\nCompute the test statistic using the observed data.\nFind the \\(p\\)-value based on the null sampling distribution.\nMake a comparison, draw conclusions, and interpret the results.\n\n\n\n15.1.1 The Null and Alternative Hypothesis\nAt the core of the framework of hypothesis testing is the concept of statistical hypotheses. Specifically, hypothesis testing is fundamentally a procedure wherein evidence within a sample is assessed to determine whether or not it contradicts a particular hypothesis.\n\nDefinition 15.2 (Statistical Hypothesis) A statistical hypothesis is a statement regarding the value of an (unknown) population parameter, informed via outside knowledge rather than through estimation. For instance, we may state that \\(\\theta = 0\\) or \\(\\theta \\geq 10\\).\n\nIn the framework of null hypothesis significance testing, we focus on the specification of two distinct hypotheses. First, and most importantly, we specify the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis corresponds to our underlying belief about the world prior to conducting statistical tests. The null hypothesis will capture how we will act without strong evidence to the contrary. In contrast to the null hypothesis, we also a specify an alternative hypothesis. The alternative gives an alternative explanation compared to the null. That is, if the null is not true, then the alternative should be.\n\nDefinition 15.3 (Null Hypothesis) The null hypothesis is a statistical hypothesis that is meant to capture the assumed state of the world that would be believed without contradictory evidence. The null hypothesis captures the value of a parameter that is assumed to hold by default. Often, the null hypothesis captures the idea of no effect or no difference, such as taking \\(\\theta = 0\\). The null hypothesis is typically denoted \\(H_0\\), so we write, for instance, \\(H_0: \\theta = 0\\) or \\(H_0: \\theta \\geq 10\\).\n\n\nDefinition 15.4 (Alternative Hypothesis) The alternative hypothesis is a statistical hypothesis that is defined in contrast to a stated null hypothesis. Generally, we take the alternative hypothesis to be not the null. If the null hypothesis states \\(\\theta = 0\\) then the alternative will be \\(\\theta \\neq 0\\). We denote the alternative as either \\(H_1\\) or \\(H_A\\). If the null hypothesis is not true, the alternative hypothesis will be.\n\nWhen framing the null and the alternative hypothesis it is important to keep in mind that we are seeking evidence against the null hypothesis. We will never seek to positively confirm that the null hypothesis actually holds. Instead, we want to see if the observed data allow us to conclude that it certainly does not hold. For this reason, the hypotheses we are considering should be determined prior to data collection and should be informed by a subject-matter understanding, rather than for statistical convenience. To determine your null hypothesis, you should ask what you would continue to believe without evidence to the contrary, and take that as the null. If you have no such prior beliefs, then it is best to take the most conservative statement as the null hypothesis.1\n\nExample 15.2 (Sadie and Charles Care for Trees: Identifying Hypotheses) Sadie and Charles have, after watching a new documentary, become quite interested in caring for trees. They have started a small tree nursery, and are interested in how statistics may be used to inform their progress through this adventure. For each of the following questions, they are looking to identify what null and alternative hypotheses may be reasonable for the following questions.\n\nThey have found a pouch of aspen seeds, but are not sure where they came from. Aspens typically grow to be a total of about \\(50\\) feet tall, with a diameter of \\(10.5\\) inches. They want to know whether these aspens seeds are similar to common aspens, or not.\nThey have many different fertilizer options. They want to know whether a particular blend of their fertilizers influences the height to which the trees grow, or not.\nThey understand that bark beetles are a problem that can often impact pine trees. Before they help reforest in a certain area, they want to know whether more than \\(10\\%\\) of pine trees are infested with bark beetles, or not, to understand whether new plants are likely to survive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we could think of running two separate hypothesis tests. If we take \\(\\theta_1\\) to represent the average height of an aspen grown from the seed, we may test \\(H_0: \\theta_1 = 50\\) versus the alternative \\(H_A: \\theta_1 \\neq 50\\). If \\(\\theta_2\\) represents the average diameter of the grown aspens, then we can test \\(H_1: \\theta_2 = 10.5\\) versus the alternative \\(H_A: \\theta_2 \\neq 10.5\\).\nHere, we require to take a parameter, say \\(\\theta_3\\), to represent the effect of the fertilizer on tree growth. Specifically, we may take \\(\\theta_3\\) to represent the average change in height that a tree receiving the fertilizer has (compared to if the tree had not received the fertilizer). Then, it is most sensible to assume by default that there is no effect, and thus \\(H_0: \\theta_3 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_3 \\neq 0\\).\nHere, the parameter of interest is \\(\\theta_4\\), the proportion of trees in a particular area that are infected with bark beetles. We may consider \\(H_0: \\theta = 0.1\\) versus the alternative \\(H_A: \\theta \\neq 0.1\\). However, in this case, it may be more prudent to actually use a one-sided hypothesis, taking \\(H_0: \\theta \\geq 0.1\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta \\leq 0.1\\). The rationale would be that, since the decision to act would only be influenced by a small value of \\(\\theta_4\\), the true interest is in whether it is smaller than \\(0.1\\), not simply whether it is different than \\(0.1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nA hypothesis test is outlined by the collective statement of the null and alternative hypotheses. When deciding on the null and alternative, there is the possibility of considering either a one-tailed or a two-tailed hypothesis test. These refer to the number of tails of the distribution that would be considered evidence against the null hypothesis, or put differently, the number of tails captured by the alternative hypothesis.\n\nDefinition 15.5 (One Tailed Hypothesis Test) In a one tailed hypothesis test, the alternative hypothesis will take the form \\(H_A: \\theta &gt; \\theta_0\\), or \\(H_A: \\theta &lt; \\theta_0\\), for some constant value \\(\\theta_0\\). In this sense, only one tail (either the upper tail in terms of \\(\\theta &gt; \\theta_0\\) or the lower tail in terms of \\(\\theta &lt; \\theta_0\\)) will be considered as evidence against the null hypothesis. In a one tailed test, the null hypothesis is given as either \\(H_0: \\theta \\leq \\theta_0\\) or \\(H_0: \\theta \\geq \\theta_0\\).2\n\n\nDefinition 15.6 (Two Tailed Hypothesis Test) In a two tailed hypothesis test, the alternative hypothesis will take the form \\(H_A: \\theta \\neq \\theta_0\\), for some constant value \\(\\theta_0\\). In this sense, both the upper and lower tails will be considered as evidence against the null hypothesis. In a two tailed test, the null hypothesis is given as \\(H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0\\).\n\nAs we continue to discuss the implementation of a hypothesis test and the practicalities in testing a particular hypothesis, we will discuss the implications in using one versus two tailed tests. The general guidance is that, unless there is a very strong, scientific rationale for considering a one tailed test, two tailed tests ought to be preferred. If a one tailed test is to be suggested, the null and alternative should still be specified prior to doing any analysis of the experiment, and which tail is tested should be informed through subject-matter expertise.3 Once the hypotheses have been selected, we need to make a choice regarding the levels of significance.\n\n\n15.1.2 Significance Levels\nIn addition to specifying the hypotheses on the basis of subject-matter knowledge, to perform a hypothesis test we must also decide on the level of significance that we are considering. Generally, the level of significance refers to the amount of evidence that we would need against the null hypothesis in order to reject it (in favour of the alternative). This decision should be informed based on the stakes of the decisions that we are making. When the stakes are high, or it is very important to not reject the null hypothesis incorrectly, we should increase the amount of evidence we are looking for.\n\nDefinition 15.7 (Level of Significance) The level of significance, denoted \\(\\alpha\\), is a measure of how much evidence is required to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative. Formally, the level of significance specifies the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, if it were actually true. In this sense, the lower the value of \\(\\alpha\\), the stronger the evidence required against the null hypothesis. Typically, \\(\\alpha \\leq 0.1\\) is selected, with the specific value dependent on the context.\n\nA fundamental truth of hypothesis testing4 is that we can never be certain in our conclusions. Owing to the inherent random nature of data, there is always the possibility that mistakes occur. The level of significance provides us with the capacity to control the likelihood of one class of these mistakes. Specifically, it controls how likely it is to conclude that the null hypothesis is not true when it is. In a perfect world, free of randomness and uncertainty, we would take \\(\\alpha = 0\\). This way, we would never conclude that the null hypothesis should be rejected when it is actually true. Unfortunately, the only way to ensure that we never make this mistake is to never reject the null hypothesis.5 Instead, we take \\(\\alpha\\) to be a small value greater than \\(0\\).\nTo decide what value specifically, we have to consider the question “What if we are wrong?” If you incorrectly reject the null hypothesis, what are the stakes of that error. Consider a scenario where we are testing a new treatment for a severe illness, and we want to test whether the treatment has an effect on survival rates. In this case, we would typically take \\(H_0: \\theta = 0\\) versus the alternative, \\(H_A: \\theta \\neq 0\\); by default we are assuming that the treatment does not have any impact, and are looking for evidence to the contrary. Now, suppose that there already exists a treatment for the illness that is moderately effective. In this setting, it is far more costly to make a mistake stating that the new treatment is also effective, if it turns out that it is not. The reason being that if we conclude the treatment is effective it may be prescribed to individuals, and this may happen in place of the existing effective treatment. If it turns out that the new treatment does not have a positive impact, this would mean that real people will receive treatments that are ineffective, when they could receive treatments that actually help. Conversely, if there does not exist any treatment at all for the illness now, we likely are willing to take a slightly higher risk. In this case, if we are wrong and the treatment does not meaningfully help, there is no alternative for the patient anyways. As a result, in the first case we should take a lower value of \\(\\alpha\\) compared to the second.\n\nExample 15.3 (Sadie and Charles Care for Trees: Identifying Hypotheses) With the statistical hypotheses identified for their tree planting hobby, Charles and Sadie are now trying to determine what level of significance they should pick in running these hypotheses. Specifically, they are looking to rank the following hypotheses in order of required significance levels, and justify these choices to one another.\n\nThey have found a pouch of aspen seeds, but are not sure where they came from. Aspens typically grow to be a total of about \\(50\\) feet tall, with a diameter of \\(10.5\\) inches. They want to know whether these aspens seeds are similar to common aspens, or not. Importantly, they have decided that they will plant the aspens no matter what they find, and care for them all the same. Because they do not know where the seeds came from, they cannot change suppliers even if they wanted to.\nThey have many different fertilizer options. They want to know whether a particular blend of their fertilizers influences the height to which the trees grow, or not. The mix of fertilizer that they are considering here is cheaper than their current fertilizer choice, and so they have a desire to switch if possible. However, they know that the current fertilizer they use is effective at increasing growth.\nThey understand that bark beetles are a problem that can often impact pine trees. Before they help reforest in a certain area, they want to know whether more than \\(10\\%\\) of pine trees are infested with bark beetles, or not, to understand whether new plants are likely to survive. If they plant trees into an infested area, these trees will likely all die relatively young, wasting resources and the ability to help revitalize the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThese hypotheses require evidence in the order that they are currently written. Namely, hypothesis (a) requires less than (b) which requires less than (c).\n\nFor (a), the hypothesis test is mostly for intrigue. It will not alter the way that Sadie and Charles act in any way, nor are there any stakes to the decision. As a result, if they are wrong, that is okay – the only impact of this is that they may tell people they found aspen seeds that grow differently compared to regular, when they have not actually done so.\nNext, is (b). The stakes here are higher since there currently exists a fertilizer that works well. If Sadie and Charles conclude that the new fertilizer also improves growth, but it does not, then they will end up with plants that are worse off than they otherwise would be had they not made the same conclusion. Fortunately, however, the fertilizer is less costly than the current one. As a result, the mistake, while impacting the growth of their trees, will not have cascading negative outcomes.\nFinally, hypothesis (c) is the hypothesis with the largest stakes. If they draw the wrong conclusion in this case, they are risking resources and opportunity. Additionally, if they find that the infestation is bad, they have remedies for this, and as such, it is important to draw the correct conclusion here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Historical Case for \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)\n\n\n\nThere is a long tradition, one which persists across many fields today, of taking \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), regardless of the situation. This tendency owes itself to early work by Ronald Fisher (a statistician largely responsible for our approach to statistical inference). In Statistical Methods for Research Workers, published in 1925, Fisher wrote “It is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not. Deviations exceeding twice the standard deviation are thus formally regarded as significant.” In 1926, Fisher further wrote “If one in twenty does not seem high enough odds, we may, if we prefer it, draw the line at one in fifty (the \\(2\\) per cent point), or one in a hundred (the \\(1\\) per cent point). Personally, teh writer prefers to set a low standard of significance at the \\(5\\) per cent point, and ignore entirely all results which fail to reach this level. A scientific fact should be regarded as experimentally established only if a properly designed experiment rarely fails to give this level of significance.”\nFisher largely worked in well-designed experiments applied to the study of agriculture. It is probably prudent to read Fisher’s advice of the \\(5\\%\\) level of significance as existing in this context. Even as the originator of taking \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), Fisher acknowledged the importance of selecting a line based on the needs of the particular context. It is a somewhat unfortunate historical artefact that his declarative statements of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) took far stronger hold on the scientific world at large, as compared to his more contextual statements. Still, with our present understanding of hypothesis testing, we should always keep in mind the context of the question we are asking, and determine an appropriate level of significance within this context.\n\n\nOnce a level of significance has been decided upon, we need to determine a method for establishing how we can assess whether the evidence in the sample achieves the level of significance or not. To do so, we rely on test statistics.\n\n\n15.1.3 Test Statistics\nTest statistics are statistics6 with a special property. Notably, if the null hypothesis is true, a test statistic must have a known distribution, with all parameter values known as well. That is, if the sampling distribution of a statistic is fully specified assuming that the null hypothesis holds, this statistic is a test statistic.\n\nDefinition 15.8 (Test Statistic) A test statistic is any statistic, which is to a say a quantity computable given a specific sample, used for hypothesis testing. Test statistics must have the property that, supposing the null hypothesis is true, the sampling distribution of the statistic is completely specified. Often, the exact sampling distribution will not be known, but a statistic can still be regarded as a test statistic if an approximate distribution is available.\n\n\nDefinition 15.9 (Null Distribution) The sampling distribution of a test statistic, assuming the null hypothesis holds, is referred to as the null distribution. We may also say that the statistic follows a particular distribution, under the null. Suppose that \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is a test statistic with a null distribution \\(F\\), then we can write \\(\\widehat{\\theta} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} F\\), to mean that, under the null, the statistic follows the distribution given by \\(F\\).\n\nBecause the null distribution is fully specified, it is possible to calculate probabilities associated with test statistics assuming that the null hypothesis holds. These probabilities will ultimately be assessed as evidence in relation to the level of significance. Typically, a test statistic can be derived by first considering a statistic, and then introducing dependence on the unknown parameters that are being tested. While these parameter values are unknown, generally speaking, if the null hypothesis is assumed to be true this will specify concretely the value of the parameter. For instance, suppose that we have a sample from a normal distribution, with a known variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)) but an unknown mean (\\(\\mu\\)). We know that the sample mean will have a normal sampling distribution, giving \\(\\overline{X} \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\). If we wish to test the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\\), for some constant \\(\\mu_0\\), then the null distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) becomes \\(N(\\mu_0, \\sigma^2)\\). This stands as a test statistic since we exactly know the distribution under the null. More commonly we may take \\(\\overline{X} - \\mu_0\\), resulting in \\(N(0, \\sigma^2)\\), or even \\[\\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0,1).\\]\nIn each case, the statistic has a known null distribution. As a result, we can solve for probabilities assuming that the null hypothesis were true. These probabilities are most commonly codified through the use of p-values.\n\n\n15.1.4 \\(p\\)-values and Critical Values\nTo determine whether there is sufficient evidence to contradict the assumed null hypothesis, we must be able to translate statements regarding our test statistic into probability values. Specifically, we can “ask what values for our test statistic could we have observed that would have been at least as contradictory to the null hypothesis as the value that we did observe?”. Then, using the null distribution, we can ask, “assuming the null hypothesis were true, how likely would it have been to observe an outcome of the test statistic at least as contradictory as the outcome we did observe?”. The probability associated with this is called the \\(p\\)-value.\n\nDefinition 15.10 (\\(p\\)-value) The \\(p\\)-value, (or probability value), is a measure of how likely the observed data is assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Specifically, the \\(p\\)-value measures the probability of observing an outcome at least as extreme7 as the outcome that was observed, based on the test statistic. This probability indicates how likely the data were to be observed by random chance, assuming the null hypothesis holds.\n\nSuppose, for sake of example, we observe a value of a test statistic, \\(t=-2\\). Under the null hypothesis, we know that \\(t\\) should equal \\(0\\). Then, we ask “what could we have observed that would have been more contradictory than what we did observe?” Suppose that we are considering a two-tailed alternative. Note that if we had observed any value of \\(t &lt; -2\\), this would have been more extreme. On the other hand, had we observed any value of \\(t \\geq 2\\), this also would have been more extreme. Thus, any value outside of the interval \\((-2, 2)\\) would have been more extreme. Thus, to work out the \\(p\\)-value in this case we would find \\[P(\\{T \\leq -2\\}\\cup\\{T \\geq 2\\}) = P(T \\leq -2) + P(T \\geq 2).\\] Had this been a one-tailed test, the \\(p\\)-value would have been only \\(P(T \\leq -2)\\).\nIntuitively, the smaller the \\(p\\)-value, the moe evidence against the null hypothesis based on the sample. If the \\(p\\)-value were sufficiently low, then it would be the case that the observation we made would be sufficiently rare, assuming the null hypothesis were true. With a small enough probability, it is more reasonable to assume that the null hypothesis is not accurate, rather than assuming that we happened to make a particularly rare observation. To decide how small of a probability is small enough, we turn to our level of significance. If the \\(p\\)-value is below the selected level of significance, then we can conclude that the results are unlikely to have been observed due to chance, and instead, it is more likely to be observed as the alternative is a better explanation of the underlying reality. On the flip side, if the \\(p\\)-value is larger than the level of significance, then we did not see sufficient evidence in the sample to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nExample 15.4 (Sadie and Charles Care for Trees: Identifying \\(p\\)-Values) Charles and Sadie are feeling quite confident in their application of hypothesis testing for tree care. They have decided on hypotheses, significance levels, and have even worked out what test statistics they will use. Now, they are hoping to practice calculating \\(p\\)-values before the data collection actually begins, to ensure that they will be able to do it later on, when it matters. Determine the \\(p\\)-values based on the given information in the following.\n\nFor the pouch of aspen seeds, they are planning to test \\(H_0: \\theta_1 = 50\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_1 \\neq 50\\). This will be done using the test statistic \\[T_1 = \\frac{\\overline{X} - 50}{10/\\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0,1).\\] Suppose than in a sample of size \\(4\\) they find \\(\\overline{x} = 60\\). For the diameters, testing \\(H_0: \\theta_2 = 10.5\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_2 \\neq 10.5\\), they will take \\[T_2 = \\frac{\\overline{X} - 10.5}{3/\\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0,1).\\] Suppose in a sample of size \\(9\\) they observe \\(\\overline{x} = 8.5\\).\nTo understand the effects of their fertilizer types, they will test \\(H_0: \\theta_3 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_3 \\neq 0\\). They will use the statistic \\[T = \\frac{\\overline{X}}{s/\\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} t_{n-1}.\\] In a sample of \\(49\\) trees, they observe \\(\\overline{x} = 3\\), with a sample standard deviation of \\(14\\).\nTo investigate the extent of the bark beetle infestation, they will test \\(H_0: \\theta_4 \\leq 0.1\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_4 &gt; 0.1\\). This can be done via \\[T=\\frac{\\widehat{p} - 0.1}{\\sqrt{0.1(0.9)/n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0,1).\\] In a sample of size \\(100\\) they observe \\(14\\) trees that are infected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing \\(T_1\\), we find an observed value, \\(t_1\\) by plugging in \\(n=4\\) and \\(\\overline{x} = 60\\). This gives \\(t_1 = 10/5 = 2\\). As a result, the \\(p\\)-value is given by \\[P(Z \\geq 2) + P(Z \\leq -2) = 1 - \\Phi(2) + \\Phi(-2) = 2(1 - \\Phi(2)) \\approx 0.046.\\] Alternatively, we could have used the empirical rule to conclude that this will be approximately \\(0.05\\). For \\(T_2\\), plugging in \\(n=9\\) and \\(\\overline{x} = 8.5\\) gives \\(t_2 = -2/1 = -2\\). Thus, for the \\(p\\)-value we would get the exact same quantity, since we need \\(P(Z \\leq -2) + P(Z &gt; 2)\\). Consider the following plot that shades the area needed to calculate the \\(p\\)-value, with \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) each labelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, taking \\(n=49\\), \\(\\overline{x} = 3\\), and \\(s = 14\\). Thus, \\[t = \\frac{3}{14/\\sqrt{49}} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5.\\] To calculate a \\(p\\)-value, we make reference to the \\(t_{48}\\) distribution, taking \\(F\\) to be its CDF, this gives \\[P(T \\leq -1.5) + P(T &gt; 1.5) = F(-1.5) + (1 - F(1.5)) = 2F(-1.5) \\approx 0.14.\\] The corresponding area is identified in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the observation has been \\(\\widehat{p} = 14/100 = 0.14\\), with \\(n=100\\). Thus, \\(t = 0.04/0.03 = 4/3\\). The \\(p\\)-value here is given by \\[P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{-4}{3}\\right) + P\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-4}{3}\\right) + \\left(1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)\\right) = 2\\Phi\\left(\\frac{-4}{3}\\right) \\approx 0.182.\\] The following plot shades the relevant region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(p\\)-value can be interpreted as the level of significance at which the observed data contradict the null hypothesis. In this sense, the \\(p\\)-value serves as a measure of how strong the evidence against the null hypothesis will be. An alternative method for the same mathematical approach is to determine how large of a test statistic value would need to be observed in order to achieve a \\(p\\)-value equal to the level of significance. If we observe a test statistic that is larger than this value that is then equivalent to observing a \\(p\\)-value which is smaller (and vice versa). This value is known as a critical value.\n\nDefinition 15.11 (Critical Value) A critical value is the value, derived through a null distribution, at which the corresponding \\(p\\)-value coincides with the significance level. That is, the critical value is the value, \\(t^*\\), such that \\[P(T \\leq -t^*) + P(T \\geq t^*) = \\alpha,\\] assuming a two-tailed hypothesis test, where \\(T\\) is the statistic of interest, and the probability is taken with respect to the null distribution.\n\nThe critical values are related to the percentiles of a distribution. Specifically, if \\(T\\) has a symmetric distribution8 then the critical value for a significance level \\(\\alpha\\) exactly coincides with the \\(1-\\alpha/2\\) percentile of the distribution. We saw these critical values being used when discussing confidence intervals, if we substitute the confidence level \\(p=1-\\alpha\\). If a critical value of \\(t^*\\) is found then if we observe \\(t\\) such that \\(|t| &gt; t^*\\), this is equivalent to observing a \\(p\\)-value that is less than \\(\\alpha\\). The \\(p\\)-value provides more information than a comparison to a critical value, however, the critical value technique can be easier to leverage for quick calculations, particularly when you are away from a computer.\n\nExample 15.5 (Sadie and Charles Care for Trees: Identifying Critical Values) While they had some success identifying the \\(p\\)-values, Charles and Sadie realize that the conclusions that the calculations for the \\(p\\)-values are highly dependent on what values they assumed they would see. However, if they approached the problems via critical values, this will be relevant as long as the null distributions are correct. For each scenario, they wish to identify the critical value associated with the given hypothesis test.\n\nFor the pouch of aspen seeds, they are planning to test \\(H_0: \\theta_1 = 50\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_1 \\neq 50\\). This will be done using a test statistic with a null distribution of \\(N(0,1)\\), at \\(\\alpha = 0.1\\). For the diameters, testing \\(H_0: \\theta_2 = 10.5\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_2 \\neq 10.5\\), they will use the same null distribution and significance level.\nTo understand the effects of their fertilizer types, they will test \\(H_0: \\theta_3 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_3 \\neq 0\\). They wish to take \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), and use a test statistic with \\(t_{n-1}\\) degrees of freedom. They suspect the sample size will be \\(49\\).\nTo investigate the extent of the bark beetle infestation, they will test \\(H_0: \\theta_4 \\leq 0.1\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_4 &gt; 0.1\\). Here, they require a significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince these tests use the same significance levels, they will have the same critical values. Notably, we require \\(\\Phi(-t^*) + 1-\\Phi(t^*) = \\alpha\\), which is equivalent to saying \\[\\Phi(-t^*) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\implies t^* = -Z_{0.1/2} \\approx 1.64.\\]\nFor this test, taking \\(F(t)\\) to represent the cumulative distribution function for a \\(t_{48}\\) distribution, we require \\(F(-t^*) + 1 - F(t^*) = \\alpha\\), which is equivalent to saying \\[F(-t^*) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\implies t^* = -F^{-1}(\\frac{0.05}{2}) = -t_{n-1,0.025} \\approx 2.01.\\]\nFor this test, the critical value must satisfy \\(1 - \\Phi(t^*) = \\alpha\\), which is equivalent to \\[\\Phi(-t^*) = \\alpha \\implies t^* = -Z_{0.01} \\approx 2.33.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nWith either the \\(p\\)-value calculated or the critical value for comparison, it is possible to draw scientific conclusions from the hypothesis test.\n\n\n15.1.5 Drawing Conclusions and Interpretation\nBy comparing the calculated \\(p\\)-value to the level of significance, or the calculated test statistic to the critical value, we are able to draw conclusions from the hypothesis test. Our conclusion will provide an answer to whether we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. Specifically, if the \\(p\\)-value is less than the level of significance, or the observed test statistic is less than the critical value9 then we can reject the null hypothesis, in favour of the alternative. We call the region of observations where we reject the null hypothesis the rejection region (see Figure 15.1). Practically this means that the level of evidence contradicting the null hypothesis in the observed data exceeds the level of evidence we needed to see, in the given context, in order to act as though the null hypothesis is not true. If the \\(p\\)-value is larger than the level of significance (or equivalently, if the critical value does not fall into the rejection region) then we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that our sample did not contain sufficient contradictory evidence to the null hypothesis, based on the context of the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: The labelled components of a hypothesis test. The observed test statistic is either compared to the critical values to see whether it falls into the rejection region or not. In a one-sided hypothesis test, the rejection region is one-sided as well. Alternatively, the area under the null distribution outside of the observed test statistic (in both tails, as depicted here, for a two-sided hypothesis test; in a single tail for a one-sided hypothesis test) can be computed as the \\(p\\)-value. The \\(p\\)-value is then compared to the level of significance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, it is not possible in the hypothesis testing framework to accept the null hypothesis. This is because our level of evidence is always assessed for the degree to which it contradicts the null hypothesis. If our observations would be unlikely assuming that the null hypothesis were true, it is reasonable for us to act as though the null hypothesis were not true. If, on the other hand, our observations do not contradict the null hypothesis, we will continue to act as though it were true, even though we have not built up positive evidence in its favour.\nWhen we reject the null hypothesis, we often say that the result is statistically significant at the \\(\\alpha\\) significance level. Statistical significance is a measure of strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nDefinition 15.12 (Statistical Significance) A result is said to be statistically significant if the null hypothesis is rejected. Specifically, the result is said to be statistically significant at a set level of significance, though, this is often implied from context. A result is said to be not statistically significant if the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n\n\nExample 15.6 (Sadie and Charles Care for Trees: Drawing Conclusions) Charles and Sadie have managed to calculate test statistics, \\(p\\)-values, and critical values for the hypothesis tests that they established. All that is left is for them to interpret what these test results actually mean. They are looking to draw and interpret conclusions, based on the following information, and ideally, they would do this both using \\(p\\)-values and critical values.\n\nFor the pouch of aspen seeds, they are testing \\(H_0: \\theta_1 = 50\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_1 \\neq 50\\), using \\[T_1 = \\frac{\\overline{X} - 50}{10/\\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0,1).\\] In a sample of size \\(4\\) they find \\(\\overline{x} = 60\\). For the diameters, they test \\(H_0: \\theta_2 = 10.5\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_2 \\neq 10.5\\), using \\[T_2 = \\frac{\\overline{X} - 10.5}{3/\\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0,1).\\] In a sample of size \\(9\\) they observe \\(\\overline{x} = 8.5\\). They wish to use \\(\\alpha = 0.1\\) level of significance.\nTo understand the effects of their fertilizer types, they test \\(H_0: \\theta_3 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_3 \\neq 0\\) using \\[T = \\frac{\\overline{X}}{s/\\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} t_{n-1}.\\] In a sample of \\(49\\) trees, they observe \\(\\overline{x} = 3\\), with a sample standard deviation of \\(14\\). They wish to use \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level of significance.\nTo investigate the extent of the bark beetle infestation, they test \\(H_0: \\theta_4 \\leq 0.1\\) versus \\(H_A: \\theta_4 &gt; 0.1\\) using \\[T=\\frac{\\widehat{p} - 0.1}{\\sqrt{0.1(0.9)/n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0,1).\\] In a sample of size \\(100\\) they observe \\(14\\) trees that are infected. They wish to use \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) level of significance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the previous examples we found that the \\(p\\)-value was approximately \\(0.046\\) for both tests. Since \\(p &lt; \\alpha\\), we can reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that, based on the sample, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the heights and diameters of the found aspen seeds are different than average aspen seeds. These results are statistically significant at the \\(0.1\\) level of significance. Alternatively, we could used the critical value of \\(1.64\\). Since \\(t_1 = 2 &gt; 1.64\\), and since \\(t_2 = -2\\), so \\(|t_2| &gt; 1.64\\), both statistics fall into the rejection region and we reject the null hypothesis at the \\(0.1\\) level of significance.\nHere we find \\(p = 0.14\\). Since \\(p &gt; \\alpha\\), we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level of significance. Thus, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence in the sample to conclude that the fertilizer has a non-zero effect on growth. Alternatively, we can consider that \\(t = 1.5\\), compared to a critical value of \\(2.01\\). Since \\(t &lt; 2.01\\), the statistic does not fall in the rejection region, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\nThe \\(p\\)-value was found to be \\(0.182\\). Since we are testing at a \\(0.01\\) level of significance, \\(p &gt; \\alpha\\), and so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. As a result, there is insufficient evidence, based on the sample, to conclude that more than \\(10\\%\\) of the pine trees are infected by bark beetles. Alternatively, we consider the critical value to be \\(2.33\\). Here, note that since this is a one-tailed test, the rejection region is only the values of \\(t\\), such that \\(t &gt; 2.33\\). Because \\(t &lt; 2.33\\) we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical significance is the foundational language of scientific inquiry. Specifically, results that are statistically significant are typically held up as actual results, where those that are not statistically significant are treated as though they are the result of random noise. In order for a claim to be scientifically justified, it must be statistically significant. However, it is important to note that statistical significance is not a measure of how big or meaningful a particular effect will be. Instead, it is a measure of how strong the evidence for believing a result is. That is, you can have statistically significant findings that are not particularly meaningful. For instance, suppose that the parameter of interest is the effect of a medical treatment on life expectancy. If we find that the treatment improves the life expectancy for patients, and that this result is statistically significant we do not know whether the treatment improves the life expectancy by a lot or a little. All we know, in this context, is that there was strong evidence in the sample that the treatment actually did improve the outcome in this case.",

    "text": "15.2 Errors in Hypothesis Testing\nWhen conducting a hypothesis test we are still dealing with uncertainty. As a result it is always possible that the conclusions that are drawn will be incorrect. By selecting an appropriate level of significance, and by selecting a test statistic with a known null distribution, we hope to minimize the possibility of errors. However, random variation can still lead to incorrect conclusions. When considering errors in the conclusions of a hypothesis test, there are two types of errors that can be made. We can either reject a null hypothesis that is actually true, or else we can fail to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. These are10 referred to as Type I and Type II errors, respectively.\n\nDefinition 15.13 (Type I Error) A type I error is a false positive. This occurs when a the null hypothesis is rejected, but the null hypothesis is actually true.\n\n\nDefinition 15.14 (Type II Error) A type II error is a false negative. This occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected, but the null hypothesis is actually false.\n\nBoth type I and type II errors are problematic, and test procedures are preferable when they minimize the probabilities of each error type. Focusing on the probability that a type I error occurs, we can determine how likely this is by asking what the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is, assuming that the null is true. That is, under the null hypothesis, what is the probability that we observe a statistic beyond the critical value. By definition, this is given by the level of significance. That is, the probability of a type I error is exactly equal to the level of significance, \\(\\alpha\\).\nThis gives an alternative method of interpreting the value of \\(\\alpha\\). Specifically, the value of \\(\\alpha\\) is the probability of making a false positive claim. Intuitively, we want this to be as small as possible, and so taking \\(\\alpha\\) to be smaller seems reasonable. Unfortunately, the probability of making a type I error tends to be inversely correlated with the probability of making a type II error. The probability of a type II error is, typically, less straightforward to determine. For it, we need to determine the probability, assuming that the null hypothesis is actually false, that we fail to reject the null. That is, under the alternative hypothesis, what is the probability that we observe a statistic value that is less than the critical value. While this is a challenging probability to determine11 explicitly, we give this the label \\(\\beta\\). If we consider the probability \\(1-\\beta\\), this gives the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually false, a true rejection. This is a quantity of particular interest in hypothesis testing, and as such, we refer to it as the power of a hypothesis test.\n\nDefinition 15.15 (Power) The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is, in fact, false. That is it gives the probability of a true rejection. The power of a test generally gives a measure of how well a test is able to detect true effects. Typically, the power of a test is denoted by \\(1-\\beta\\), where \\(\\beta\\) gives the probability of a type II error.\n\nA hypothesis test would ideally have a low probability of a type I error, which is to say a low level of significance, and a corresponding high power. Unfortunately, typically as the level of significance of a test decreases, so too does the power, and vice versa. As a result, in any hypothesis testing scenario there is a need to make a deliberate trade-off between the level of significance and the power. Typically, hypothesis testing proceeds by selecting an appropriate level of significance for the given setting, and then among tests that achieve this level of significance, searching for a test with the highest power. This way the type I errors are controlled at a set level, and the type II errors are minimized. By recognizing that the probabilities of type I and type II errors need to be balanced against one another, it is possible to more intentionally select an appropriate level of significance. Specifically, it is worth thinking through, in any given setting, whether the prospect of a false positive or a false negative is a worse outcome, and then balancing the selected rates accordingly.\n\n\n\nTable 15.1: Conclusions and errors of hypothesis testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is True\n\\(H_0\\) is False\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is Rejected\nFalse Positive  Type I Error  (\\(\\alpha\\))\n True Positive Power (\\(1-\\beta\\))\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is Not Rejected\nTrue Negative \nFalse Negative Type II Error  (\\(\\beta\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 15.7 (Charles and Sadie Care for Trees: Possible Errors) With an understanding of how they can draw conclusions using null hypothesis significance testing, Charles and Sadie turn to questioning “what if we are wrong?” Specifically, they want to think about different hypothesis tests that they can run as they continue their tree nursery, with a focus on understanding what a type I or type II error would refer to in each case, and whether they should prioritize a low level of significance or a high power for the corresponding tests.\n\nCharles and Sadie wish to consider whether the germination rate of a new seed variety is any different from the historical average. The new seed is more expensive than historical seeds, and they are not currently displeased with the seeds that they have been using.\nThey wish to investigate whether a new fertilizer that is substantially cheaper than their current fertilizer is offered. They wish to test whether there is an improvement of the new fertilizer, compared with the old one.\nCharles is told of a new treatment that promises to increase the disease resistance in seedlings. The treatment is relatively affordable, and does not seem to have any negative impacts, but they are concerned that it may not actually work.\nSadie has been researching techniques for protecting plants through the winter. Their current strategy works reasonably well, but Sadie thinks that with a little more investment, they may be able to improve this dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, a Type I error represents the conclusion that the new seed variety differs from the historical average when, in fact, it does not. A type II error would occur if Sadie and Charles fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that there is no evidence of a difference between the current and historical seeds, when such a difference really does exist. Because they are currently happy with their current seeds, and because the new seeds more expensive, they would want to be very certain that the new seeds are in fact different if they are going to switch. As a result, they should be considering a lower level of significance here, reducing the probability of type I error.\nIn this case, a Type I error occurs if they conclude the new fertilizer is improved, if it really is not an improvement, where the type II error occurs if they see no evidence of improvement when there really is. Because the fertilizer is cheaper, they would save money if they managed to switch, and thus it is important for them to identify if there really is an improvement. Missing an improvement that exists is a costly mistake, and so they should prioritize higher power in order to minimize the negative consequences associated with missing out.\nIn this case, a Type I error occurs if they conclude that the treatment actually does increase the resistance to diseases in plants, when it does not in actual fact. A type II error would occur if they conclude that there is no evidence for suggesting that the treatment reduces diseases, but it actually does. Here, because the treatment is affordable and seems otherwise harmless, it is worse to conclude that it does nothing if it actually works compared to concluding that it does nothing if it does not. As a result, a higher power is preferable.\nIn this case, a Type I error occurs if they conclude that the new strategy works better than the old strategy, when it does not actually. Type II errors occur if the new strategy works better, but they do not find sufficient evidence to conclude this in the sample. Here, they currently have a functioning strategy, and it would cost more to move to a new one. As a result, they need to make sure that if they do move, it is an improvement. This corresponds to a lower level of significance.",

    "text": "15.3 Hypothesis Testing for Population Means\nThe general procedure for hypothesis testing is versatile and applies in a wide range of scenarios. Whenever there is a need to test a particular parameter, the outlined steps can be followed and, supposing that an appropriate test statistic is found, a valid hypothesis test will be derived. With that said, there are several parameters that are tested with enough frequency that the corresponding hypothesis testing procedures are worth studying specifically. In the following sections, we outline the specific procedures for testing hypotheses relating to population means and proportions. These procedures are specific instantiations of the previously outlined procedures, and serve as example use cases for the overarching framework of hypothesis testing.\n\n15.3.1 \\(Z\\) Tests for Population Means in Normal Populations\nSuppose that we are interested in testing hypotheses relating to the mean of a normal distribution, with a known variance. In this context, we have that \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is unknown. We have seen that the sample mean, \\(\\overline{X}\\), has a sampling distribution given by \\(N(\\mu,\\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{n})\\). As a result, suppose that we wish to test the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\\). Then, assuming the null hypothesis holds, we must have that \\(E[\\overline{X}] = \\mu_0\\), and more specifically, \\[T = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0, 1).\\] Suppose that we observe \\(T = t\\), then owing to symmetry we can compute the relevant \\(p\\)-value as \\[P(T \\leq -|t|) + P(T \\geq |t|) = P(Z \\leq |t|) + (1 - P(Z \\leq -|t|)) = 2\\Phi(-|t|).\\] If, instead, we had wished to use the critical value method, then we would need to solve \\[2\\Phi(-t^*) = \\alpha \\iff t^* = Z_{1-\\alpha/2},\\] where \\(Z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\) is the critical value of the standard normal. If instead a one-tailed hypothesis test were run, we would take the \\(p\\)-value to be \\(\\Phi(t)\\) (or \\(1-\\Phi(t)\\)), and the critical value as either \\(Z_{\\alpha}\\) or \\(Z_{1-\\alpha}\\), depending on whether the upper or lower tail test is being run.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.2: Illustration of the \\(Z\\)-test, depicting the observed statistic (solid line), area for the \\(p\\)-values (shaded areas), and locations of the critical value (dotted lines). In this example, the critical value is at \\(1.96\\), and the observed statistic is at \\(-2.473\\). Thus, it falls outside of the critical value. Additionally, the shaded area gives the p-value, \\(0.013\\), which is less than the implied significance level of \\(0.05\\). Consider where the critical values would fall had \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) been used instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(Z\\) Tests for Population Means in Normal Populations with Known Variances\n\n\n\nIf data are selected from a normal population, with a known variance, then the \\(Z\\) test is the most common test to apply for hypotheses surrounding the population mean. Specifically, the test statistic is \\[T = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}},\\] where \\(\\mu_0\\) is the value of the mean under the null hypothesis. Then, supposing \\(T=t\\) is observed:\n\nIf \\(H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0\\), the \\(p\\)-value is \\(2\\Phi(-|t|) = 2(1 - \\Phi(|t|))\\). The corresponding critical value is \\(Z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\).\nIf \\(H_0: \\mu \\geq \\mu_0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\mu &lt; \\mu_0\\), the \\(p\\)-value is \\(\\Phi(t)\\). The corresponding critical value is \\(Z_{\\alpha}\\).\nIf \\(H_0: \\mu \\leq \\mu_0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\mu &gt; \\mu_0\\), the \\(p\\)-value is \\(1 - \\Phi(t)\\). The corresponding critical value is \\(Z_{1-\\alpha}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n15.3.2 One Sample \\(t\\) Tests for Population Means\nSuppose instead that we are dealing with a population with an unknown variance, but we are still only interested in the mean of the population. If the population is either normally distributed, or else if the sample size is large enough so as to justify the use of the Central Limit Theorem, then we know that \\(\\overline{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), however, \\(\\sigma^2\\) is unknown. We have seen that we can replace \\(\\sigma\\) with \\(s\\), the sample standard deviation, and update the corresponding sampling distribution to a \\(t_{n-1}\\). This result suggests that we run a \\(t\\)-test, taking \\[T = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} t_{n-1}.\\] Suppose that we observe \\(T=t\\), then owing to symmetry we can compute the relevant \\(p\\)-value as \\[P(T \\leq -|t|) + P(T \\geq |t|) = 2F(-|t|),\\] where \\(F(t)\\) is the cumulative distribution function for the \\(t_{n-1}\\) distribution. If instead we wish to use the critical value method, then we would need to solve \\[2F(-t^*) = \\alpha \\iff t^* = t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2},\\] where \\(t_{n-1,1-\\alpha/2}\\) is the critical value from the \\(t_{n-1}\\) distribution. If instead a one-tailed hypothesis test were run, we would take the \\(p\\)-value to be \\(F(t)\\) (or \\(1-F(t)\\)), and the critical value as either \\(t_{n-1, \\alpha}\\) or \\(t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: Illustration of the \\(t\\)-test, based on \\(n=32\\), depicting the observed statistic (solid line), area for the \\(p\\)-values (shaded areas), and locations of the critical value (dotted lines). In this example, the critical value is at \\(2.04\\), and the observed statistic is at \\(1.81\\). Thus, it falls inside of the critical value. Additionally, the shaded area gives the p-value, \\(0.080\\), which is greater than the implied significance level of \\(0.05\\). Consider where the critical values would fall had a one tailed hypothesis test been used instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\) Tests for Population Means in Normal Populations or Large Samples\n\n\n\nIf data are selected from a normal population, or from a non-normal population with a sufficiently large sample size, with an unknown variance, then the \\(t\\) test is the most common test to apply for hypotheses surrounding the population mean. Specifically, the test statistic is \\[T = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}},\\] where \\(\\mu_0\\) is the value of the mean under the null hypothesis. Define the sample size to be \\(n\\). Then, supposing \\(T=t\\) is observed, and taking \\(F(t)\\) to be the cumulative distribution function for the \\(t_{n-1}\\) distribution:\n\nIf \\(H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0\\), the \\(p\\)-value is \\(2F(-|t|) = 2(1 - F(|t|))\\). The corresponding critical value is \\(t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2}\\).\nIf \\(H_0: \\mu \\geq \\mu_0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\mu &lt; \\mu_0\\), the \\(p\\)-value is \\(F(t)\\). The corresponding critical value is \\(t_{n-1, \\alpha}\\).\nIf \\(H_0: \\mu \\leq \\mu_0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\mu &gt; \\mu_0\\), the \\(p\\)-value is \\(1 - F(t)\\). The corresponding critical value is \\(t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n15.3.3 Hypothesis Tests for Population Proportions\nSuppose that instead of concern with a population mean, we are instead concerned with a population proportion. We can either view the data as coming from a sample of \\(n\\) independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables, with success probability \\(p\\), or, equivalently, we can view these data as a single realization from a \\(\\text{Bin}(n, p)\\) distribution. In the first case, take \\[\\widehat{p} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = \\overline{X},\\] and so through the Central Limit Theorem, as long as \\(n\\) is sufficiently large, \\(\\widehat{p}\\) will be approximately normal.12 At this point, supposing we are testing a hypothesis of \\(p\\) as it relates to \\(p_0\\), then under the null \\(\\widehat{p} \\sim N(p_0, p_0(1-p_0)/n)\\). As such, \\[T = \\frac{\\widehat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0, 1).\\] Correspondingly, we can apply a \\(Z\\)-test for the population proportions, following exactly the same procedure outlined above.\nNote that in the case of a population proportion, the specification of the proportion under the null hypothesis also specifies the population variance. This is because in a Bernoulli distribution, the mean and variance are governed by a single parameter. This means that we need not estimate the variance from the sample, nor consider the \\(t\\) distribution. If the null hypothesis holds, then the population mean will be exactly \\(p_0\\) and the variance \\(p_0(1-p_0)/n\\). However, this is still an approximate hypothesis test since it relies on the use of the Central Limit Theorem to justify normality.",

    "section": "15.4 Further Considerations of Hypothesis Testing",
    "text": "15.4 Further Considerations of Hypothesis Testing\nThe process of hypothesis testing is used extensively across a wide variety of scenarios. It is quite flexible, and can accommodate any types of data or any hypotheses of interest, so long as a suitable test statistic and null distribution can be derived. With that said, hypothesis testing is not a panacea for scientific inquiry. It needs to be carefully and critically applied, informed by the context of the situation and driven by our underlying subject-matter expertise. We saw the importance of this when informing the hypothesis to test, whether to use a one-sided or two-sided alternative, and in selecting a threshold for the level of significance. At every stage of the process care is required in order to ensure that the results of our hypothesis tests are useful and valid.\n\n15.4.1 Practical Significance versus Statistical Significance\nA key consideration in the application of hypothesis testing is differentiating between those results that are statistically significant13 and those results that are practically significant. Practical significance, broadly speaking, indicates whether a particularly effect actually matters given the underlying context.\n\nDefinition 15.16 (Practical Significance) A result is said to be practically significant if the effect is large enough to be meaningful in the real-world. Practical significance is not achieved on the basis of statistical analyses, but rather, on the basis of the subject-matter expertise. The degree of practical significance is somewhat subjective, and will depend on the particular context.\n\nTo assess practical significance in practice we should ask ourselves, supposing that the observed effects are real, do we even care? Consider a lifestyle intervention that, in medical studies, is found to increase an individual’s life expectancy by \\(1\\) day. This result may or may not be statistically significant, depending on the degree of evidence in the observed sample. However, this result is almost certainly not practically significant. That is because, even if it were found to be a strong statistical result, it is likely not a result that is large enough to care about it in practice. On the flipside, a lifestyle intervention that increases life expectancy by \\(10\\) years is likely to be very practically significant.\nA result is only meaningful if it achieves both statistical significance and practical significance. Without statistical significance, we do not have strong enough evidence to believe that the observed result is really different from our null hypothesis. Without practical significance, we do not care about the existence of the result broadly. The combined statistical and practical significance means that, not only is there good evidence for the result, but there is also value in considering the result.\nCritically, the degree of statistical significance is not a measure of practical significance. That is, a smaller \\(p\\)-value does not necessarily mean that the result is more practically significant. The measure of statistical significance is orthogonal to the measure of practical significance. Instead, to assess practical significance, we consider the size of the effect directly. The measure of effect size will be dependent on the given scenario and the specific parameter that is being assessed. This should be measured relative to known information in the field. Thus, if we are interested in the mean result, perhaps the effect size is given by the mean difference between the sample mean and the value under the null hypothesis. If we are interested in a proportion, we may take the absolute size of the proportion to measure the effect. Whatever value we can compare to our existing experience will serve as a basis for assessing the degree of practical significance that has been attained.\n\n\n15.4.2 The Connection Between Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Levels\nIn discussing hypothesis testing we reintroduced many of the same concepts that were introduced during our discussions of confidence intervals as well. This is not coincidental, and it is not merely an aesthetic similarity. There is a fundamental connection between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, one that renders them to be equivalent, in a sense, mathematically. More concretely, a confidence interval and a hypothesis test that are based on the same underlying statistic will always agree with one another.\nSuppose that a hypothesis test is run, testing \\(H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0\\), and the computed \\(p\\)-value is \\(0.01\\). This means that, assuming that the null hypothesis is true, there is a probability of \\(0.01\\) that we would observe a result as extreme as the one we actually did. Now, recall that a confidence interval gives a range of values that, prior to actually conducting the sample, achieves some set probability of containing the true value. Suppose we construct a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval. This interval will have a probability of \\(0.95\\) of containing the truth, or put differently, there is a probability of \\(0.05\\) that the truth does not fall inside this interval. If we construct the interval on the same data for which we found a \\(p\\)-value of \\(0.01\\), where should we expect \\(\\theta_0\\) to fall relative to our interval? The probability, assuming \\(\\theta = \\theta_0\\), that we observe a statistic as extreme as we did is \\(0.01\\). This is notably smaller than the \\(0.05\\) probability that the truth would fall outside of the interval, and as such, we should not expect to see \\(\\theta_0\\) in the interval.\nConcretely, if a \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) confidence interval is formed and it contains the null value \\(\\theta_0\\), then the \\(p\\)-value for a hypothesis test of \\(H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0\\) will have a \\(p\\)-value that is greater than or equal to \\(\\alpha\\). If the \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) confidence interval is formed and does not contain the null value \\(\\theta_0\\), then the \\(p\\)-value for the hypothesis test will be less than \\(\\alpha\\). Equivalently, if the \\(p\\)-value when testing \\(H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0\\) is found to be \\(\\alpha\\), then every confidence interval that is at least as wide as \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) will contain \\(\\theta_0\\), and every interval that is more narrow than this will not contain the null value.\nOne way to conceptualize this more concretely is to consider that a confidence interval is effectively giving you the set of values that, based on your sample, you have no evidence to differentiate between. Any value in your confidence interval is justified by the sample in being considered the true value. This justification stems from the fact that, prior to the construction of the interval, there was only an \\(\\alpha\\) probability that the true value would not be in the interval, and so the values in this interval remain plausible based on the evidence. In a hypothesis test, we are trying to assess whether our sample contradicts a particular value for the truth, at a given threshold for evidence. If the value we are trying to reject is contained within our confidence interval, the logic of the confidence interval suggests that we should not reject it as possible. On the flipside, if the value we are interested in falls outside of the confidence interval, our sample seems to reject its plausiblity.\n\n\n15.4.3 Critiques of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing\nDespite the prevalence of hypothesis testing and the seemingly intuitive derivation of the procedure it is not without its faults, and it is not free of detractors. There are many critiques of hypothesis testing that are valid, and that should be seriously considered before an uncritical application of the procedures. The critiques of hypothesis tests tend to fall into two categories: there are the critiques about the application of hypothesis testing in practice, and there are critiques about the underlying foundation of hypothesis testing. The first can be remedied through careful application of the procedures we have discussed. The second represents a more philosophical debate, one in which competing sources of evidence need to be weighed against one another. Statisticians who are particularly critical of hypothesis testing, as it has been outlined here, often propose alternative procedures to accomplish similar goals. These frameworks are often rooted in fundamentally different approaches to the understanding of uncertainty, such as those emerging from the Bayesian paradigm. Such approaches to scientific knowledge and inquiry can be quite useful, but will not pursued further in these notes.\nWhile there are many critiques of hypothesis testing, we focus on four foundational concerns.\n\nEffects are (basically) never truly zero. Most of the time, hypothesis testing is setup with a null hypothesis of \\(H_0: \\theta = 0\\). This typically refers to the effect of some intervention (such as a medical treatment), or the difference in outcomes achieved after making some change, or similar. The hypothesis test then seeks to determine, based on the observed evidence, is the effect of interest really different from zero. Many individuals critique this framing since, in practice, we should not expect any effect to be exactly zero. Every factor likely exerts some influence, no matter how small, on any related factors. It may not be practically significant in terms of its effect size, but the only quantities that will truly have no effect on eachother are quantities that are not likely to be tested against one another. As a result, for many hypothesis tests, the framework is setup to disprove a statement that no one actually believes. We are not seeking evidence of effect size, just that it is different from zero, but likely we should approach every situation expecting the effects to be different from zero.\nIn hypothesis testing, \\(p\\)-values are prioritized above all else. \\(p\\)-values are, at their core, a statistic computed based on a particular sample that provide a measure of the level of evidence against a null hypothesis. This is a continuous measure of evidence, with any value \\((0,1)\\) being theoretically possible. The process of hypothesis testing takes this continuous measures and expresses it discretely as either “statistically significant” or else “not statistically significant”, treating this discretization as the sole arbiter of whether an effect is real or not. Not only is there information lost by moving from a continuous measure to a discrete one based on only two categories, but this process also ignores other important sources of information that should likely be considered alongside a \\(p\\)-value. For instance, alongside a \\(p\\)-value we may wish to consider whatever prior evidence of the claim we may have, the scientific validity or plausibility of the underlying finding, the quality of the data or the study, the practical significance, and so forth. The critique in this context is not so much that \\(p\\)-values are not useful, but rather, that a sole reliance on \\(p\\)-values ignores many important factors.\nThe null hypothesis is often a strawman. This is related to the first point, but is more broad than the idea that we can typically assume that effects are non-zero. Recall that the null hypothesis is meant to be the default belief about the world, the state of affairs that we ought to believe without sufficient evidence contradicting it. A null hypothesis that actually satisfies this critieria is required for the utility of the hypothesis testing framework. Often, however, the null hypothesis that is selected is one that effectively noone would actually believe. This is a strawman.14 If the null hypothesis is not truly believed by anyone, or if it is so unlikely as to be irrelevant, then refuting it with a hypothesis test tells us nothing. At the heart of the hypothesis testing framework is the concept of falsification. We are not looking for positive, confirmatory support in favour of a particular hypothesis, but rather looking to falsify the null hypothesis. If the idea that we are falsifying is not particularly relevant, then the fact that we have falsified it is also not particularly relevant. Unfortunately, in practice, irrelevant null hypotheses are often used.\nThe hypothesis testing framework is ripe for abuse. In any statistical analysis there are many choices that need to be made by individual conducting the analysis. Often there are many reasonable sounding choices that could lead to valid results, if those choices are guided by substantive considerations. Different choices which may be reasonable in different settings can, if applied to the same analysis, lead to very different conclusions. This is a reality in any statistical analysis, but is particularly concerning in the hypothesis testing framework where there is often a single goal for the researcher, namely, find a result that is statistically significant. A researcher that is setting out to achieve statistical significance at all costs is able to make many choices that aid in this attempt, if so desired. This process, known as p-hacking, can be intentional or unintentional, and can involve decisions that are reasonable from the outside or deisions that are explicitly fraudulent. For instance, an investigator may consider using a one-sided hypothesis test, a choice that, while reasonable in some settings, has the effect of halving the observed \\(p\\)-value. Researchers may throw out certain data that they deem to be outliers because they do not follow the underlying trend they are looking for. Researchers may perform many different analyses, and only report those that happened to be statistically significant.15 The arbitrary nature of the level of significance is another area of choice for the researchers – if they calculate a \\(p\\)-value and find it to be \\(0.08\\), taking \\(\\alpha = 0.1\\) allows them to report a statistically significant effect. The sum total of these choices means that any particular analysis, even if well-intentioned, may be subject to an artificially deflated \\(p\\)-value, achieving the moniker of statistical significance unfairly.\n\nThese critiques are not just theoretical. There has been, in recent years, major concerns over the replicability of research in a wide range of fields. While there are many aspects that drive this so-called replication crisis, the inappropriate use of hypothesis testing is certainly among the explanations. In light of these critiques, it is worth questioning whether the framework of hypothesis testing is worthy of pursuit. Generally, it is reasonable to answer this with a cautious “yes”. However, it is critically important to take seriously these criticisms. Hypothesis teseting should not be used to the exclusion of other forms of evidence. The hypothesis tests should not be dichotomized as “significant” or “not significant” where all results that are “significant” are treated as gospel and those that are “not significant” are treated as false. The selected null hypothesis should be a genuine null hypothesis, and the choices made in the analysis should be made prior to collecting or analyzing data on the basis of the context of the situation, rather than on the basis of what happens to be observed. Hypothesis testing should be used to support scientific inquiry, not as the sole tool of scientific inquiry. In short, the process of hypothesis testing provides a useful, statistical framework for assessing the degree of evidence that exists within a sample, however, it should never be applied uncritically.",

    "text": "15.5 Hypothesis Testing in R\nHypothesis testing in R can proceed in one of two ways. First, test statistics can be directly computed, and then functions (such as pnorm or similar) can be used to compute \\(p\\)-values according to the null distribution. Alternatively, many common hypothesis tests are built into R to begin. The most relevant function, given the tests that were discussed throughout this chapter, is the t.test function. This will perform a \\(t\\)-test, based on a sample of data, contrasting the mean against a particular value. Moreover, the t.test function will, by default, produce confidence intervals for the mean, allowing both to be reported alongside one another. If you wish to perform a hypothesis test that is not built-in, then this can be accomplished using the same procedures outlined for confidence intervals.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "title": "16  Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals in Two Populations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "16.1 Two Populations Rather than One\nWith confidence intervals and hypothesis tests we began to make inferences regarding populations by quantifying our levels of uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty sits at the core of inferential statistics, and through this we are able to effectively draw conclusions and learn about populations. With that said, the procedures discussed so far have focused on individual parameters from individual populations. While there are many scientific questions relating to a single parameter from a single population, it is perhaps more common to consider the comparison between two populations.1 To answer questions relating to the comparison of multiple populations, we must extend the ideas of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to the setting where we have samples from two (or more) populations.\nIn the one population setting we supposed that we observed \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\) as an independent and identically distributed sample from some population. We then considered parameters of this population2 and addressed questions relating to these parameters. In the two population setting, we introduce a second independent and identically distributed sample, \\(Y_1,\\dots,Y_m\\), from a second population. The distribution for the \\(Y\\)s may or may not be the same distribution as the distribution for the \\(X\\)s. Moreover, the distribution of \\(X\\) and of \\(Y\\) may be independent of one another, or they may be related to one another. We will take \\(F_X\\) and \\(F_Y\\) to represent the distribution of \\(X\\) and the distribution of \\(Y\\), respectively, and we will use the same notational conventions for the parameters of these distributions. So, for instance, we may take \\(\\mu_X\\) and \\(\\mu_Y\\) to represent the population means, or \\(\\sigma_X^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y^2\\) to represent the population variances. The size of the samples we draw may be equal, or not. We assume that there are \\(n\\) observations taken from \\(F_X\\) and there are \\(m\\) observations take from \\(F_Y\\). Each of these samples could be used for individual hypothesis testing or estimation, using the procedures that we have previously seen.\nWe will typically be concerned with the same parameters and estimators we have been considering previously. For instance, it is common to consider the population means. To this end we have \\(\\mu_X\\), which can be estimated by \\(\\overline{X}\\), and we have \\(\\mu_Y\\), which can be estimated by \\(\\overline{Y}\\). Even if \\(\\mu_X = \\mu_Y\\) in practice, it is unlikely that we will observe \\(\\overline{X} = \\overline{Y}\\), exactly. This may lead us to consider whether we can perform a hypothesis test that asks whether, based on the observed information, the two populations have exactly the same mean.\nTo do this, we want to test \\(H_0: \\mu_X = \\mu_Y\\) versus the alternative, \\(H_A: \\mu_X \\neq \\mu_Y\\). In order to determine how to test this hypothesis, it is helpful to re-express it as a single parameter. Notice that if \\(\\mu_X = \\mu_Y\\), then \\(\\mu_X - \\mu_Y = 0\\). We can rewrite the previous hypotheses as \\(H_0: \\mu_X - \\mu_Y = 0\\) and \\(H_A: \\mu_X - \\mu_Y \\neq 0\\). If we define a new parameter, \\(\\Delta = \\mu_X - \\mu_Y\\), such that \\(\\Delta\\) represents the difference in mean values for the two distributions,3 then we can state our hypothesis test as \\(H_0: \\Delta = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\Delta \\neq 0\\).\nThis test is no different from any of the tests we have seen before. If we can work out an estimator for \\(\\Delta\\), and work out the null distribution for this estimator, we can use the procedures outlined for null hypothesis significance testing to assess how much evidence exists against the hypothesis that the means are equal. Similarly, if we are able to work out an estimator for \\(\\Delta\\), and we can identify the sampling distribution of this estimator, then we can form confidence intervals for \\(\\Delta\\), allowing both point and interval estimation to proceed for the difference in population means.\nIn order to estimate \\(\\Delta\\), it is helpful to consider that \\(\\Delta = \\mu_X - \\mu_Y\\). We know that \\(\\overline{X}\\) is an effective estimator for \\(\\mu_X\\) and that \\(\\overline{Y}\\) is an effective estimator for \\(\\mu_Y\\). Taken together, it is reasonable to suggest that an estimator for \\(\\Delta\\) is given by \\[\\widehat{\\Delta} = \\overline{X} - \\overline{Y}.\\] Since both \\(\\overline{X}\\) and \\(\\overline{Y}\\) are unbiased for \\(\\mu_X\\) and \\(\\mu_Y\\), then \\(\\widehat{\\Delta}\\) will also be unbiased for \\(\\Delta\\). If we are able to assess the null and sampling distributions of \\(\\widehat{\\Delta}\\), we can leverage the same procedures for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests we have already discussed. Determining these distributions depends on the assumptions made regarding the distributions \\(F_X\\) and \\(F_Y\\), as well as the relationship between them.\nNote that the same general approach could have been used to test hypotheses beyond the equality of the population means. For instance, suppose we wanted to know whether the mean of \\(X\\) was \\(10\\) units larger than the mean of \\(Y\\). This corresponds to \\(\\mu_X = \\mu_Y + 10\\), or \\(\\mu_X - \\mu_Y = 10\\), and so we can test it using \\(H_0: \\Delta = 10\\) versus the alternative \\(H_0: \\Delta \\neq 10\\). Alternatively, what if we had hypothesized that \\(\\mu_X\\) was really half as large as \\(\\mu_Y\\)? In this case, we get that \\(2\\mu_X = \\mu_Y\\), or \\(2\\mu_X - \\mu_Y = 0\\). Now, if we introduce \\(\\Delta_{2} = 2\\mu_X - \\mu_Y\\) then we can test \\(H_0: \\Delta_2 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\Delta_2 \\neq 0\\). To estimate \\(\\Delta_2\\), we can note that \\(2\\mu_X\\) is estimated well by \\(2\\overline{X}\\), and so \\[\\widehat{\\Delta}_2 = 2\\overline{X} - \\overline{Y},\\] is a reasonable estimator.4\nBeyond testing additional hypotheses related to the mean difference, we can also test alternative parameters in the distribution using a similar approach. Suppose we have two separate binomial distributions. Here we may have \\(p_X\\) and \\(p_Y\\) as the relevant proportions, and we may be interested in testing whether \\(p_X = p_Y\\) or not. To do so, we can use the exact same procedure, taking \\(\\Delta = p_X - p_Y\\), and testing \\(H_0: \\Delta = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\Delta \\neq 0\\).5 Because \\(\\widehat{p} = \\overline{X}\\), we can use the exact same estimator, \\(\\widehat{\\Delta}\\), and continue in the same process outlined above. Alternatively, we may consider the variances of the population. By framing \\(\\sigma_X^2 = \\sigma_Y^2\\), we can follow a similar procedure, either taking the difference \\(\\Delta = \\sigma_X^2 - \\sigma_Y^2\\), or, more commonly, the ratio, \\(\\rho = \\dfrac{\\sigma_X^2}{\\sigma_Y^2}\\), and then testing hypothesis such as \\(H_0: \\Delta = 0\\) or \\(H_0: \\rho = 1\\), versus the alternatives \\(H_A: \\Delta \\neq 0\\) or \\(H_A: \\rho \\neq 1\\).\nThe key idea when dealing with two samples from two populations is to frame the question in terms of a parameter of the joint distribution. Then, estimation (point and interval), and hypothesis testing can proceed on the basis of the single parameter that has been identified. At this point, it is a matter of working out the sampling distribution, and implementing the same procedures explored in the one sample case. The difficulty lies in determining the sampling and null distributions of these estimators.",

    "text": "16.2 Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals for Mean Differences in Independent Populations\nIn order to determine the sampling and null distribution when dealing with two samples of data, a key assumption that needs to be clarified is whether or not the populations are independent of one another. If we know that \\(X \\perp Y\\), then it is typically more straightforward to derive the sampling and null distributions. Consider, specifically, \\(\\Delta = \\mu_X - \\mu_Y\\). As discussed, we can estimate \\(\\Delta\\) using \\(\\widehat{\\Delta} = \\overline{X} - \\overline{Y}\\). We have seen that \\[\\overline{X} \\sim N(\\mu_X, \\sigma_X^2) \\quad\\text{ and }\\quad \\overline{Y} \\sim N(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y^2),\\] where these are the exact distributions if the populations are normal, and these hold approximately in large samples otherwise. Note that, regardless of the dependence or independence of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), it will always be the case that \\[E[\\widehat{\\Delta}] = E[\\overline{X}] - E[\\overline{Y}] = \\mu_X - \\mu_Y = \\Delta.\\] That is, \\(\\widehat{\\Delta}\\) is unbiased for \\(\\Delta\\). If we are willing to assume that \\(X \\perp Y\\), then \\[\\text{var}(\\widehat{\\Delta}) = \\text{var}(\\overline{X}) + \\text{var}(\\overline{Y}) = \\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma_Y^2}{m}.\\]\nIf the two samples we take are independent of one another, then we can conclude that \\[\\widehat{\\Delta} \\sim N(\\Delta, \\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma_Y^2}{m}).\\] This result immediately allows for the calculation of confidence intervals, using the normal based confidence intervals previously investigated, whenever the variance terms, \\(\\sigma_X^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y^2\\) are known. If these variances are unknown, then the variance can be estimated using the individual sample variances, \\(S_X^2\\) and \\(S_Y^2\\). Replacing \\(\\sigma_X^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y^2\\) with these results in an underlying \\(t\\) distribution, with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom, where \\[\\nu = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{S_X^2}{n} + \\frac{S_Y^2}{m}\\right)^2}{\\frac{(S_X^2/n)^2}{n-1} + \\frac{(S_Y^2/m)^2}{m-1}}.\\] Note that this is typically a fairly complicated expression, and so instead we will often take \\(\\nu = \\min\\{n-1,m-1\\}\\).

Then, depending on whether the variances are assumed to be known, or not, we can use a \\(Z\\)-test or a \\(t\\)-test for hypothesis testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis Tests for Differences of Means in Independent Populations\n\n\n\nIf we have data selected from two, independent populations (denoted \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\) and \\(Y_1,\\dots,Y_m\\)), and we wish to test hypotheses relating to the relationship in population means, we can use a \\(Z\\)- or \\(t\\)-test, based on our knowledge of the population variances.\n\nIf \\(\\sigma_X^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y^2\\) are known, then \\[T = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\overline{Y} - \\Delta_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma_Y^2}{m}}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0, 1).\\] Assuming that we observe \\(T=t\\),\n\nIf \\(H_0: \\Delta = \\Delta_0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\Delta \\neq \\Delta_0\\) then the \\(p\\)-value is \\(2\\Phi(-|t|)\\).

The corresponding critical value is \\(t_{\\nu, 1-\\alpha}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.1 Pooled Variance Estimation\nSometimes, even when \\(\\sigma_X^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y^2\\) are unknown, it is reasonable to assume that the variances of the two populations will be equal. That is, we may have good reason to suspect that \\(\\sigma_X^2 = \\sigma_Y^2\\), even if we do not know the value of \\(\\sigma_X^2\\).6 In these settings, instead of taking two separate variances, we ultimately have a single parameter, \\(\\sigma^2\\). When this happens, we can revisit the sampling distribution, noting that \\[\\overline{X} - \\overline{Y} \\sim N\\left(\\Delta, \\sigma^2\\left[\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{m}\\right]\\right).\\] If \\(\\sigma^2\\) is known, then the previously discussed sampling and null distributions are valid, taking \\[\\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma_Y^2}{m} = \\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right).\\]\nIf the variance is unknown, it still needs to be estimated using the data. This can be done using the pooled variance estimator, \\(S_p^2\\). Namely, \\[S_p^2 = \\frac{(n-1)S_X^2 + (m-1)S_Y^2}{n+m-2}.\\] Leveraging this pooled variance estimator gives \\[\\frac{\\overline{X} - \\overline{Y} - \\Delta}{S_p\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}}} \\sim t_{n+m-2},\\] and the equivalent null distribution when \\(\\Delta\\) is replaced by \\(\\Delta_0\\). Note that here there are \\(n+m-2\\) degrees of freedom. Otherwise, the same procedures – either using the \\(Z\\)-based or \\(t\\)-based intervals or tests – can proceed with the pooled variance in place of the independent variances.\nThe pooled variance estimator represents an anti-conservative approach to quantifying uncertainty. That is, if the same analysis is done with the pooled variance and with the unpooled variances, you should expect narrower confidence intervals and smaller \\(p\\)-values if the pooled variance is used. This can be an effective way of making complete use of prior knowledge, when the variances of the populations are actually equal. However, in the event that the variances are not actually equal, using the pooled variances will lead to erroneous conclusions. For this reason, you should rely on subject-matter guidance to determine whether equal variances should be assumed. If there is a strong scientific basis for the equality of the variances, and the data do not seem to dramatically contradict this assumption, then using pooled variances may be reasonable. Otherwise, you should estimate the variances separately.\n\n\n16.2.2 Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Tests for Multiple Proportions\nThe previous discussions centered around testing population means. Implicitly, this investigated populations that are continuous, where the mean is the primary measure of interest. The same techniques apply equally well to considering two population proportions. Namely, if \\(X \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, p_X)\\), and \\(Y \\sim \\text{Bin}(m, p_Y)\\), it may be of interest to us to determine the relationship between \\(p_X\\) and \\(p_Y\\). We may wish to proceed either with the estimation (point and interval) of the difference between \\(p_X\\) and \\(p_Y\\), or else to test hypotheses regarding the relationship of \\(p_X\\) and \\(p_Y\\). Recall that in the case of a single proportion we made use of the fact that, for large samples, the sample proportion will be approximately normally distributed. The same general technique applies in the case of two populations.\nSince both \\(\\widehat{p}_X\\) and \\(\\widehat{p}_Y\\) are approximately normally distributed, their difference will also be approximately normally distributed. Supposing that we are willing to assume that \\(X\\perp Y\\), then \\[\\widehat{p}_X - \\widehat{p}_Y \\sim N\\left(p_X - p_Y, \\frac{p_X(1-p_X)}{n} + \\frac{p_Y(1-p_Y)}{m}\\right).\\] This sampling distribution allows for the construction of approximate confidence intervals for the difference in proportions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals for Differences of Proportions in Independent Populations\n\n\n\nTo estimate the difference of two population proportions, \\(p_X - p_Y\\), from populations that are independent of one another, we can form confidence \\(Z\\)-based confidence intervals. Supposing that \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are both sufficiently large, take \\[\\widehat{p}_X - \\widehat{p}_Y \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}_X(1-\\widehat{p}_X)}{n} + \\frac{\\widehat{p}_Y(1-\\widehat{p}_Y)}{m}}.\\]\nIf there is a desire to ensure that the computed interval is conservative, then \\(\\widehat{p}_X\\) and \\(\\widehat{p}_Y\\) can both be replaced by \\(0.5\\). This will maximize the standard error, and will ensure coverage of the interval even if the estimated proportion is off in the current sample.\n\n\nThe same approach can be extended to test hypotheses relating to the population differences. If we consider the hypothesis \\(H_0: p_X - p_Y = 0\\), then assuming the null hypothesis holds we know that \\(p_X = p_Y = p\\), for some value \\(p\\). If this is the case then the variance of \\(\\widehat{p}_X - \\widehat{p}_Y\\) can be expressed as \\[\\text{var}(\\widehat{p}_X - \\widehat{p}_Y) = p(1-p)\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right).\\] This variance is maximized by taking \\(p = 0.5\\), and so we can ensure conservative hypothesis tests of the hypothesis \\(H_0: p_X - p_Y = 0\\) (or the one-sided alternatives). On the other hand, suppose that the null hypothesis was given by \\(p_X - p_Y = c\\), for \\(c \\neq 0\\). Then, \\(p_X = p + c\\) and \\(p_Y = p\\), for some proportion \\(p\\). In this setting, \\[\\text{var}(\\widehat{p}_X - \\widehat{p}_Y) = \\frac{(p+c)(1-(p+c))}{n} + \\frac{p(1-p)}{m}.\\] This does not simplify in the way that the variance expression simplifies under the null hypothesis of equality. Further, this expression is not easily maximized over \\(p\\). Without careful choice of \\(p\\) this approximation tends to perform rather poorly. As a result, if we wish to test \\(H_0: p_X - p_Y = c\\), for any \\(c \\neq 0\\), then we require alternative procedures, not relying on the normal approximation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis Tests for Equality of Proportions in Two Independent Populations\n\n\n\nTo test \\(H_0: p_X - p_Y = 0\\) versus the alternative \\(H_A: p_X - p_Y \\neq 0\\), using data from two independent populations, with success proportions \\(p_X\\) and \\(p_Y\\) respectively, we can use a \\(Z\\)-test based on \\[T = \\frac{\\widehat{p}_X - \\widehat{p}_Y}{0.5\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0,1).\\] Then, the two-tailed \\(p\\)-value can be computed as \\(2\\times\\Phi(-|t|)\\), when \\(T=t\\).\n\nTo test \\(H_0: p_X - p_Y \\geq 0\\) versus the alternative \\(H_A: p_X - p_Y &lt; 0\\), the \\(p\\)-value will be given by \\(\\Phi(t)\\).\nTo test \\(H_0: p_X - p_Y \\leq 0\\) versus the alternative \\(H_A: p_X - p_Y &gt; 0\\), the \\(p\\)-value will be given by \\(1 - \\Phi(t)\\).",

    "text": "16.3 The Analysis of Paired Data\nWhen the populations are independent from one another, regardless of whether a common variance is assumed or not, the two-population problem can be transformed into a question regarding a single parameter by adequately adjusting the sampling and the null distributions. Ultimately, this results in the same \\(Z\\)- and \\(t\\)-based procedures introduced previously. It will often be the case, however, that we cannot assume independence between the populations. If we cannot assume independence between the two populations, there will not be a single method of proceeding with investigating mean differences. Instead, our results will depend on the manner in which the populations are dependent. While many different forms of dependence may be of interest, a common assumption is that the populations are paired. By paired we mean that \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) are observations that are naturally connected to one another, for instance, by being measurements of different quantities on the same unit, or measurements of the same unit overtime, or similar. When data are paired, it will always be the case that the samples are of the same size, taking \\(n=m\\).\n\nDefinition 16.1 (Paired Data) Paired data refer to observations in a dataset that are linked to one another through some underlying, natural connection. Data may be paired because they are taken on the same unit, or because the observations are connected in another meaningful way. In paired data, there is an obvious and meaningful one-to-one correspondence between measurements of one variable and another.\n\nSuppose, for instance, that we measure the same trait at two different points in time, for all the same units. Then \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\) correspond to the first measurements that are taken, and \\(Y_1,\\dots,Y_n\\) correspond to the second. Here, \\(X_1\\) and \\(Y_1\\) are naturally paired since they are the same unit observed at two points in time. We expect that \\(X_1\\) and \\(Y_1\\) will be related to one another, though, not exactly the same. The same can be said for \\(X_2\\) and \\(Y_2\\), and more generally for \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\). When data are paired they are not independent.\nSuppose that, with paired data, we concerned with hypotheses regarding mean differences, considering for instance \\(H_0: \\mu_X - \\mu_Y = 0\\). In independent samples we considered the difference of sample means as an estimator, \\(\\overline{X} - \\overline{Y}\\), where the samples of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) could have been of possibly different sizes. If we consider the same quantities when data are paired, we can rewrite the expression as follows: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X} - \\overline{Y} &= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i - \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - Y_i) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n D_i.\n\\end{align*}\\] Here, \\(D_i = X_i - Y_i\\) is the difference between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) within each pair. In other words, when data are paired, we can first consider the differences between observations, giving a set of \\(n\\) observations, \\(D_1, \\dots, D_n\\). Then, using this single sample, we can construct confidence intervals or perform hypothesis tests.\nOnce the sample of differences is formed, the problem of interval estimation or hypothesis testing is no different from the one sample procedures outlined. The sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{D}\\) is exactly normal if both \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) are exactly normal, and it will be approximately normal using the Central Limit Theorem if \\(n\\) is sufficiently large. The expected value, \\(E[\\overline{D}] = \\mu_X - \\mu_Y\\), according to the exact same logic applied for the independent case. The only slight difficulty is with the variance, where notably \\[\\text{var}(\\overline{D}) = \\frac{\\sigma_X^2 + \\sigma_Y^2 - 2\\sigma_{XY}}{n}.\\] Here \\(\\sigma_{XY}\\) is the covariance between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (Definition 7.4).7 Typically, for paired data, \\(\\sigma_{XY} &gt; 0\\) and so the variance will be smaller than when it is assumed that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent of one another. Because of this, making the assumption that the data are paired is an anti-conservative assumption. There needs to be good reason to suppose that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) really are paired, and that they should be analyzed in this manner, as otherwise the \\(p\\)-values may be artificially deflated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals for Differences of Means in Paired Populations\n\n\n\nTo estimate the difference of two population means, \\(\\mu_X - \\mu_Y\\), from populations that are paired with one another, we can form confidence \\(Z\\)- or \\(t\\)-based confidence intervals, depending on whether the variances are known or not. First, we find the paired differences, \\(D_i = X_i - Y_i\\), and then consider the sample \\(D_1, \\dots, D_n\\) as a single sample.

First, we find the paired differences, \\(D_i = X_i - Y_i\\), and then consider the sample \\(D_1, \\dots, D_n\\) as a single sample.

    "text": "19.1 Linear Relationships and Lines of Best Fit\nSo far, we have only considered individual estimation and inference (for single parameters) or else the comparison between single parameters. While these estimation and comparison procedures are widely applicable and a powerful basis for inquiry, they fail to capture an important type of statistical analysis. Specifically, the forms of estimation and hypothesis testing considered thus far have not provided a means of capturing the relationship between two (or more) variables. Regression models generally provide on method for accomplishing this task.\nThe most basic mathematical function that we can conceive of is a straight line. We can consider the equation of a line, \\[y = mx + b,\\] where \\(y\\) is the dependent variable and \\(x\\) is the independent variable. In this equation, \\(m\\) represents the slope of the line,1 a quantity that indicates how much the value of \\(y\\) changes as the value of \\(x\\) changes. The term \\(b\\) represents the intercept of the line,2 which corresponds to the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x=0\\). This relationship is deterministic in that, if \\(y = mx + b\\) actually holds, then we can perfectly know the value of \\(y\\) for any value of \\(x\\), simply by specifying the values \\(m\\) and \\(b\\).\nDespite the simplicity of the linear relationship, it remains a very powerful model for investigating the relationship between two variables. There are many quantities that follow a deterministic linear relationship, and we can exploit this simple pattern to understand their joint behaviour. For instance, if we have a vehicle that is traveling at a constant speed, then the distance traveled, \\(d\\), is given by the linear relationship \\(d = mt\\), where \\(m\\) is the speed and \\(t\\) is the time of travel. If you have an investment that will pay simple interest, then the total payout \\(P\\), is given by the linear relationship \\(P = mx + x\\), where \\(m\\) is the rate of return, and \\(x\\) is the initial investment. As a final example, the temperature measured in Fahrenheit, \\(F\\), is given by \\(F = 1.8C + 32\\), where \\(C\\) is the temperature measured in Celsius.\nIn each of these cases the dependent variable, also called the response variable, can be exactly explained by constants as well as the independent variable, also known as the predictor or explanatory variable. While there are many other situations that can be exactly described using linear relationships, there are even more settings in which an approximate linear relationship between the predictor and the response will hold. These are the situations that we are concerned with in the simple linear regression model.",

    "text": "19.2 The Simple Linear Regression Model\n\n19.2.1 Approximating Linear Relationships\nIn the case of modelling the relationship between two or more variables, we need to consider data collection as consisting of two or more records on the same unit. For simplicity, suppose we observe one outcome (\\(y\\)) and one predictor (\\(x\\)). Then, if we wanted to take a sample of \\(n\\) units from the population, the data we collected would consist of pairs, \\((x_i, y_i)\\) for \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). That is, we would take \\(\\{(x_1,y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_n, y_n)\\}\\). In this case, \\(x_1\\) is the predictor for the first unit, and \\(y_1\\) is the outcome for the first unit; \\(x_2\\) is the predictor for the second unit, and \\(y_2\\) is the predictor for the second unit; and so forth. We can conceive of this data collection procedure in much the same way that we have conceived of all data collection procedures to date. Namely, \\(x_1,\\dots,x_n\\) are realizations of some random variable, \\(X\\), that has some population distribution, and \\(y_1,\\dots,y_n\\) are realizations of \\(Y\\) with some other population distribution. If we are concerned with the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then we are working from the assumption that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not independent of one another. It is also convention to use \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) to describe the explanatory and response variables, respectively.\nEven in settings where a perfect linear relationship between two or more variable is theoretically justified, in collected data we will not often observe an exact linear relationship. Suppose we are measuring the distance traveled, when traveling at a constant speed, across multiple points in time. There will be some level of uncertainty in our measures of the distance traveled, either because we have made mistakes, or because our instruments for measuring distance are not perfect, or because there is a finite amount of precision that can actually be detected by the tools. The same issues are likely to impact our measures of time. Moreover, it is likely not possible to travel at exactly constant speeds, and so the underlying assumptions generating the exact linear model will likely not hold, precisely. However, we should still find that, in this case, a linear model will do a fairly good job of capturing the relationship between distance and speed.\nWhen we have other quantities, specifically quantities where there may not be a theoretically justified linear relationship between the response and predictor, it may still be the case that a linear relationship can approximate the dependence between the variables. One technique for assessing the appropriateness of a linear relationship is through the use of scatter plots. Scatter plots are plots of bivariate data, where the values of one variable are plotted along the \\(x\\)-axis and values of a second variable are plotted along the \\(y\\)-axis. Each observation, \\((x_i, y_i)\\) is then plotted as a single point at the corresponding location on the plane. By investigating the relationship displayed in the plot, we can observe whether or not a linear relationship appears appropriate. By convention we will place the outcome on the \\(y\\)-axis and the predictors on the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\nDefinition 19.3 (Scatter Plot) A scatter plot is a visual display of bivariate data in which observations are plotted at the Cartesian coordinates of their observed location. Typically, the \\(x\\)-axis will be used for the independent factors, and the \\(y\\)-axis will be used for the dependent factors.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.1: A demonstration of three scatter plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Approximate linear relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Nonlinear relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) No relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy considering the scatter plot, we can determine whether there appears to be an approximate linear relationship between the response and the predictors. Recognizing the sampling variability that is inherent to all data, we need not observe a perfect linear relationship. As long as a straight line appears to capture a dominant component of the trend, it is possible to use a linear model to represent the relationship between the variables. In cases where a linear relationship is entirely inappropriate, it may be the case that we observe patterns that appear to follow some other functional, non-linear relationship. For instance, it is common to see data that appear to exhibit the relationship \\(y \\approx e^x\\), or \\(y \\approx \\log(x)\\), or perhaps \\(y = x^2\\). In each of these cases, we may still be able to present the data as having an approximately linear relationship if we transform the outcome. In the above examples, this corresponds to stating that \\(\\log(y) \\approx x\\), or \\(e^y \\approx x\\), or \\(\\sqrt{y} \\approx x\\) (see Figure 19.2).3\n\n\n\nFigure 19.2: A demonstration of three scatter plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Exponential relationship, transformed via logarithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Logarithmic relationship, transformed via exponential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Quadratic relationship, transformed via square root.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have established that the relationship between a response and a predictor appears to follow an (approximately) linear relationship, the natural follow-up question is how we determine specifically what that relationship is. Naturally, given a plot that demonstrates an approximately linear relationship, we can likely draw-in the line of best fit using our intuition. Informally, the line of best fit will be the straight line that best explains the pattern we see in the data. That means it will get as close to as many of the points as possible, while not exhibiting a systematic bias, trying to balance the points that are over- and under-estimated. To find this line, formally, we can leverage simple linear regression.\n\n\n19.2.2 The Model and Assumptions\nAt its core, a linear regression model is a mathematical model for the conditional mean of the response variable. Namely, with simple linear regression we stipulate that \\[E[Y|X=x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x.\\] Here, \\(\\beta_0\\) takes the role of the intercept parameter, and \\(\\beta_1\\) takes the role of the slope parameter. That is, instead of indicating that \\(Y\\) follows an exactly linear relationship, we say that on average \\(Y\\) will be linear (in \\(x\\)). Because the average of \\(Y\\) given \\(X=x\\) is linear, we know that the actual observations of \\(Y\\) will fall around this line, either higher or lower depending on sampling variability. We also know that they should not be biased towards one side or the other, as on average, they will sit on the line. As a result, we will typically postulate that \\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon,\\] where \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random variable, not dependent on the value of \\(x\\), such that \\(E[\\epsilon] = 0\\) and labeling \\(\\text{var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2\\). We will typically refer to \\(\\epsilon\\) as the error term.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.3: The linear regression model, wth the labeled mean and two separate error terms. Each of the points is comprised of the mean component (blue line) plus or minus some error term that deviates in the \\(y\\) direction. Each of these errors could be labeled in the same way. These errors are taken to have a constant variance, and a mean of \\(0\\), when considered across the full population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this assumption, we can re-derive that \\(E[Y|X=x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\). Note that this model is referred to as the simple linear regression model, since it has only a single predictor variable. If we specify multiple predictor variables in otherwise the same form, this remains a linear regression model, however, it is no longer labeled “simple”.\n\nDefinition 19.4 (Simple Linear Regression Model) A simple linear regression model is a statistical model specified for the conditional mean of a response variable, conditioned on a single explanatory variable. The model postulates that the conditional mean of the response is a linear function of predictor, such that \\(E[Y|X=x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\).\n\nThe key assumption when using linear regression is that this mean relationship, that \\(E[Y|X=x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\), is a good representation of the truth. Without linearity of the mean, using a linear regression will provide misleading results. Implicitly, this also means that we are taking \\(Y\\) to be a continuous variable.4 A secondary assumption that we have made implicitly in the specification of this model is that the amount of variability in the error term does not depend on \\(X\\). This assumption is called homogeneity and is typically summarized as being an assumption of constant variance.5 Mathematically, we can frame this as assuming that \\(\\text{var}(\\epsilon|X=x) = \\sigma^2\\), for any value \\(x\\).\n\nDefinition 19.5 (Homogeneity (assumption)) The assumption of homogeneity (often expressed as saying that the data are homogeneous), requires that the variance of the error terms in a model do not depend on the predictors in that model. That is, there is a constant variance across all observations in the model.\n\nBy assuming that \\(E[Y|X=x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\), and that otherwise, \\(Y = E[Y|X=x] + \\epsilon\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) has mean \\(0\\) and does not depend on the value of \\(X\\), then this model has specified the parametric form for \\(Y|X=x\\). Namely, \\[E[Y|X=x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\quad\\text{ and }\\quad \\text{var}(Y|X=x) = \\sigma^2.\\] It is this random variable, \\(Y\\), that we are primarily concerned with, conditional on \\(X\\). Note that sometimes it will be convenient to make further assumptions regarding \\(\\epsilon\\). Most commonly, we may assume that \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). Under this assumption, we end up further assuming that \\[Y|X=x \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x, \\sigma^2).\\] This assumption is not necessary for the estimation of the regression parameters, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), but it will be useful if we wish to conduct inference regarding the parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Note on the Randomness of \\(X\\)\n\n\n\nMany authors will discuss linear regression under the assumption that \\(X\\) is nonrandom. That is, they suppose that \\(Y\\) is a random variable, and that \\(X\\) is simply a set of fixed values. They then discuss the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\). Mathematically, this convention is entirely equivalent to the one that we are exploring, since we are considering the value of \\(Y\\) conditional on \\(X\\). In some settings, it is far more sensible to take one approach or the other. For instance, if you are running a designed experiment, then \\(X\\) will typically denote the level of the treatment variable that you are modifying. In this setting, the level of the treatment variable is decided upon by yourself, and so there is no randomness there at all: you have picked the values of \\(X\\), and then measured the random \\(Y\\). Conversely, if you are considering observational data, then typically we treat every observation as random since none of it was directly controlled.\nEven when \\(X\\) is treated as random, as it is in our discussion, it is important to note that we never make assumptions regarding the distribution of \\(X\\), except insofar as it relates to the distribution of \\(Y\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\). That is, our predictors can be drawn from any population distribution, and our discussion holds as written. If this is a deterministic distribution, that does not cause any issue. Whether you approach linear regression from the viewpoint of a random \\(X\\) quantity, where we are doing everything conditioned on the variable, or if you take \\(X\\) to be fixed and \\(Y\\) depends on the fixed value, the interpretation and estimation is equivalent.\n\n\n\n\n19.2.3 Estimation of Model Parameters\nEstimation in the simple linear regression refers specifically to estimation of the parameters, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). Under the specified model, with estimates for both the intercept and the slope, the procedure provides an estimate of the line of best fit, and equivalently, for the conditional mean of \\(Y\\) given \\(X=x\\). Denote the estimators for \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) as \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\), respectively. Then, if estimates for these quantities were worked out, we could also write \\[\\widehat{E}[Y|X=x] = \\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1x.\\] That is, the estimated conditional mean, given some value of \\(x\\), can be derived through these estimators.\nIn the data that we have observed, we will have \\(\\{(x_1, y_1), \\dots, (x_n, y_n)\\}\\) observed in pairs. If we apply our estimated relationship, \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1x_i\\) to any specific individual, if the estimators are well-behaved then this should be close to the true value, \\(y_i\\). We will typically write \\[\\widehat{y}_i = \\widehat{E}[Y|X=x] = \\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1x.\\] In a sense, the difference between \\(y_i\\) and \\(\\widehat{y}_i\\) is the “mistake” that the estimated regression line makes on the specific individual. It is the amount of the outcome that is not captured by the regression model. We refer to these quantities as the residuals.\n\nDefinition 19.6 (Residuals (Regression Model)) Broadly speaking residuals refer to the difference between the true value of an outcome, and the value of the outcome that is implied by the estimated model. For simple linear regression, the residuals for an individual with predictor \\(x_i\\) and outcome \\(y_i\\) are given by \\[e_i = y_i - (\\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1x_i) = y_i - \\widehat{y}_i.\\] The residuals can be viewed as estimated values for the errors, \\(\\epsilon_i\\), since if \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0 = \\beta_0\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1 = \\beta_1\\), then \\(e_i = \\epsilon_i\\).\n\nIntuitively, in order to have the line of best fit, we want to have the residuals be as small as possible across the entire dataset. Importantly, however, we want to consider both positive and negative residuals as being equally far from the truth. If the value implied by the model is \\(10\\) units larger than the truth, or if the value implied by the model is \\(10\\) units larger than the truth, these both constitute an error of \\(10\\) units. As a result, instead of consider \\(e_i\\) alone, we will instead consider the squared residuals, \\(e_i^2\\). Specifically, the line of best fit, the estimated regression line, will be defined by the parameters that minimize the sum of the squared residuals.\n\nDefinition 19.7 (Estimated Regression Line (Line of Best Fit)) The estimated regression line, also referred to as the line of best fit, is the line that is estimated from a set of data based on \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\). This line is taken to be the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. Namely, the estimated regression line is defined by finding \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) such that \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\widehat{\\beta}_0 - \\widehat{\\beta}_1x_i)^2,\\] is minimized. This procedure is referred to as the least squares procedure, or sometimes, ordinary least squares.\n\nThrough the least squares procedure, the line of best fit can be derived. In the case of linear regression, the estimators \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) take on a specific form, based on the observed data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ordinary Least Squares Estimators for Simple Linear Regression\n\n\n\nIn a simple linear regression, based on observed data \\(\\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_n, y_n)\\}\\), the ordinary least squares estimators, \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\), are given by \\[\\widehat{\\beta}_0 = \\overline{Y} - \\widehat{\\beta}_1\\overline{X} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\widehat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})(Y_i - \\overline{Y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2}.\\] Note that the estimator for \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) can be viewed as taking the sample covariance between \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\), divided by the sample variance of \\(x\\). Namely, the sample covariance is \\[S_{XY} = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})(Y_i - \\overline{Y}) \\implies \\widehat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{S_{XY}}{S_{XX}}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\int\\): The Least Squares Derivation for the Simple Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to derive the least squares estimator for the simple linear regression, we require the use of multivariate differential calculus. Specifically, if we wish to find the parameters that minimize \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2\\), then we can proceed by first solving for the partial derivatives of this quantity, with respect to the parameters of interest, and then jointly solving for these equations equal to \\(0\\). This gives \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\widehat{\\beta}_0}\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 &= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\widehat{\\beta}_0} (y_i - \\widehat{\\beta}_0 - \\widehat{\\beta}_1x_i)^2 \\\\\n&= -2\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\widehat{\\beta}_0 - \\widehat{\\beta}_1x_i) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\widehat{\\beta}_1}\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 &= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\widehat{\\beta}_1} (y_i - \\widehat{\\beta}_0 - \\widehat{\\beta}_1x_i)^2 \\\\\n&= -2\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\widehat{\\beta}_0 - \\widehat{\\beta}_1x_i)x_i.\n\\end{align*}\\] Next, we need to jointly set these two quantities equal to \\(0\\), solving for the parameters. Rearranging the first gives \\[\\begin{align*}\n0 &= -2\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \\widehat{\\beta}_0 - \\widehat{\\beta}_1x_i \\\\\n0 &= \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - n\\widehat{\\beta}_0 - \\widehat{\\beta}_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\\n\\widehat{\\beta}_0 &= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \\widehat{\\beta}_1\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\\n\\widehat{\\beta}_0 &= \\overline{y} - \\widehat{\\beta}_1\\overline{x}.\n\\end{align*}\\] The same general procedure can be applied to the second expression, giving \\[\\begin{align*}\n0 &= -2\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\widehat{\\beta}_0 - \\widehat{\\beta}_1x_i)x_i \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\overline{y} - \\widehat{\\beta}_1\\overline{x} - \\widehat{\\beta}_1x_i)x_i \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\overline{y})x_i - \\widehat{\\beta}_1(x_i - \\overline{x})x_i.\n\\end{align*}\\] Note that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\overline{y})= 0\\), and so we can subtract off \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\overline{x}(y_i - \\overline{y})\\) and \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\widehat{\\beta}_1(x_i - \\overline{x})\\overline{x}\\), and not change the overall expression. This gives the required result, \\[\\begin{align*}\n0 &= \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\overline{y})(x_i - \\overline{x}) - \\widehat{\\beta}_1(x_i - \\overline{x})(x_i - \\overline{x}) \\\\\n\\widehat{\\beta}_1 &= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\overline{y})(x_i - \\overline{x})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nThe line of best fit, in the simple linear regression, then depends on only the sample means of both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), as well as on the sample variance of \\(x\\) and the sample covariance of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). From these quantities, we are able to derive the closed form estimators for the intercept and slope parameters, which in turn define the estimated regression line. The estimated regression is as such taken to be the best line in the sense that the sums of the squared residuals will be minimized among all possible linear relationships.6 With the estimated linear relationship found, we can turn towards considering interpretation and inference for the parameters and overall relationship.\n\n\n19.2.4 Interpretation and Inference Regarding Model Parameters\nIn the deterministic linear relationship, \\(y = mx + b\\), \\(b\\) was interpreted as the \\(y\\)-intercept, which is to say the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x=0\\), and \\(m\\) was interpreted as the slope, which is to say the change in \\(y\\) for a \\(1\\) unit change in \\(x\\). These interpretations carry over to the coefficients in the linear regression model. The key distinction is that in the deterministic relationship these are exact. For the linear regression model we must remember that \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\) is a model for the mean of \\(Y\\) given \\(X=x\\). That is, our interpretations will not center on the values of \\(Y\\) specifically, but rather on the average values of \\(Y\\).\nTo understand the interpretation of the parameters, we can consider separate points that isolate the parameters themselves. First, consider what happens for a data point that has \\(X = 0\\). In this case we find, \\[E[Y|X=0] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(0) = \\beta_0.\\] Thus, the expected value of \\(Y\\) when \\(X\\) is \\(0\\) is exactly equal to the intercept, \\(\\beta_0\\). As a result, in order to interpret \\(\\beta_0\\), we can suggest that it is the mean of the outcome when the predictor is \\(0\\). Next, consider two different points. If we first take \\(X=x\\), and then consider a second point with \\(X=x+1\\), then we can take the difference between these two quantities. This gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[Y|X=x] &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x \\\\\nE[Y|X=x+1] &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x + 1) \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_1 \\\\\nE[Y|X=x+1] - E[Y|X=x] &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_1 - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x) \\\\\n&= \\beta_1.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, \\(\\beta_1\\) represents the change in the expected outcome when \\(X\\) increases by a single unit. In practice, we will not have the values of the parameters exactly, and so our interpretation will rely on estimates of these parameters. This means that we interpret \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) as an estimate of the average value of the outcome when the predictor is \\(0\\), and we interpret \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) as an estimate of the average change in the outcome for a \\(1\\) unit increase in the predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretations of the Parameters in a Simple Linear Regression\n\n\n\nConsider a simple linear regression model, specified by \\[E[Y|X=x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x.\\]\n\nIn this model, \\(\\beta_0\\) corresponds to the average outcome when the predictor is \\(0\\).\nIn this model, \\(\\beta_1\\) corresponds to the average change in the outcome when the predictor increases by \\(1\\).\n\nThe estimates for these parameters, \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\), correspond to estimates of these quantities.\n\n\nIt is important to note that whether the parameters have interpretations that are substantively interesting depends on the specific context. For instance, it may be the case that \\(X=0\\) is not a meaningful quantity, depending on what \\(X\\) measures. Consider if the regression model is predicting some health outcome using blood pressure as the predictor, \\(X\\). In this case, it is not particularly meaningful to predict the health outcome if \\(X=0\\). There are other cases where the prediction may be reasonably assumed to equal \\(0\\), but that this is not an interesting case. Consider, for instance, if \\(Y\\) represents the revenue that a company will earn based on the amount that they spend on advertising (\\(X\\)). It is unlikely that the company will spend \\(0\\) on advertising in any situation, and as a result, the intercept becomes of little interest. Similar considerations can occur for the slope parameter as well. In particular, if a \\(1\\) unit change in the predictor is unrealistic or uninteresting, then the slope parameter does not have a particularly interesting meaning. Consider, for instance, any regression model that relies on a proportion as a predictor. In this case, \\(X \\in [0,1]\\), and so most changes of \\(X\\) will not be of size \\(1\\). Alternatively, consider a regression model that relies on annual income as a predictor, measured in dollars. In this case, a \\(\\$1\\) change in income is not likely a sizable enough effect to care deeply about.\nTo avoid concerns with the scale of the predictor being off, either because \\(1\\) unit change is too large or too small, we can adjust the linear regression model in one of two ways. First, we can transform the predictors so that they are measured on a scale where a \\(1\\) unit change is meaningful. This relies on multiplying or dividing all of the observations of \\(X\\) by some constant. Consider, for instance, the proportions example. Measured as a value between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), a \\(1\\) unit change is unreasonable. However, if we multiply all of the proportions by \\(100\\), then our predictors are measured as percentages instead. In this case, a \\(1\\) unit change corresponds to a \\(1\\%\\) change, which is more likely to be relevant. Similarly, in the income example, we could perhaps measure income in thousands of dollars. To do so, we would divide \\(X\\) by \\(1000\\). Then, a \\(1\\) unit change in the predictor corresponds to a \\(\\$1000\\) change in income, which is more likely to be relevant. If we scale the predictors up or down, the estimated parameter values for the intercept will not change. Moreover, the slope value will be scaled by the same constant, in the opposite way. If we multiply \\(X\\) by \\(100\\), the newly estimated \\(\\beta_1\\) will be \\[\\widehat{\\beta}_1^\\text{new} = \\dfrac{\\widehat{\\beta}_1}{100}.\\] Similarly, if we divide \\(X\\) by \\(1000\\), then the newly estimated \\(\\beta_1\\) will be \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1^\\text{new} = 1000\\times\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\). As a result, we need not actually refit the regression model with the transformed predictors. Instead, we can scale up or down the estimate to operate on a scale that is more relevant.\nA mathematically equivalent, but conceptually distinct, method of reinterpreting the slope coefficient returns to the initial method used to determine the meaning of the parameters. Recall that we considered two separate data points, one with \\(X=x\\) and one with \\(X=x+1\\). If a difference of \\(1\\) is not meaningful, then we could have instead considered a difference of \\(\\delta\\), for some \\(\\delta\\) that is meaningful. For instance, in the proportion example perhaps \\(\\delta = 0.01\\), and in the income example perhaps \\(\\delta = 1000\\). Then, using the same strategy as before, \\[\\begin{align*}\nE[Y|X=x] &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x \\\\\nE[Y|X=x+\\delta] &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x + \\delta) \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\delta\\beta_1 \\\\\nE[Y|X=x+1] - E[Y|X=x] &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\delta\\beta_1 - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x) \\\\\n&= \\delta\\beta_1.\n\\end{align*}\\] As a result, we can say that \\(\\delta\\beta_1\\) is the expected change in the outcome for a \\(\\delta\\) unit increase in the predictor. This results in the same scaling as before, but in certain settings, it may be more clear to envision.\nThe interpretations of the parameter estimates does not explicitly account for the uncertainty in estimation. If we had access to the true parameter values, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), we would be able to directly interpret the values as outlined. Unfortunately, the estimators are subject to the same uncertainty that all estimators are. As such, it is important to consider the sampling distribution of the parameters, and use this to quantify our uncertainty in the values of the parameters.\nWithout assuming normality, we can derive the expected value and variance of the two estimators. Importantly, both \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) are unbiased estimators of the truth, meaning \\[E[\\widehat{\\beta}_0] = \\beta_0 \\quad\\text{ and }\\quad E[\\widehat{\\beta}_1] = \\beta_1.\\] For the variances, each of them depends on the overarching variance of the error terms, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Specifically, \\[\\text{var}(\\widehat{\\beta}_0) = \\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2}{n\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \\overline{X})^2}\\right) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\text{var}(\\widehat{\\beta}_1) = \\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \\overline{X})^2}\\right).\\] Under the assumption that the errors are normal7 then regardless of the sample size, the sampling distribution of the parameters will also be normal. In the case of a large sample then the sampling distributions will be approximately normal, regardless of the distribution of the errors. These sampling distributions can be used to construct confidence intervals for the parameters, or to conduct hypothesis tests regarding their values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sampling Distribution for Simple Linear Regression Estimators\n\n\n\nAssuming the linear model for a simple linear regression holds, and that the error variances are homogenous with a variance of \\(\\sigma^2\\), then so long as the sample size (\\(n\\)) is large, or that the errors can be assumed to be normally distributed, both the estimators for the intercept and slope parameters will have normal sampling distributions. Specifically, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\widehat{\\beta}_0 &\\sim N\\left(\\beta_0, \\ \\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2}{n\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2}\\right)\\right); \\ \\text{and}\\\\\n\\widehat{\\beta}_1 &\\sim N\\left(\\beta_1, \\ \\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2}\\right)\\right). \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nBecause the parameters are normally distributed, statistical inference from the normal distribution applies. Specifically, both confidence intervals and hypothesis tests can be conducted using a normal distribution, when \\(\\sigma^2\\) is assumed to be known, and using a \\(t\\) distribution if \\(\\sigma^2\\) is replace by its estimated value. Specifically, if we denote the standard errors of \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) as \\(SE(\\widehat{\\beta}_0)\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\),8 then a \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) confidence interval is given by \\[\\widehat{\\beta}_j \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2}SE(\\widehat{\\beta}_j),\\] if \\(\\sigma^2\\) is known, and otherwise, by \\[\\widehat{\\beta}_j \\pm t_{n-2,\\alpha/2}\\widehat{SE}(\\widehat{\\beta}_j).\\] These results also directly permit the use of \\(Z\\)-tests or \\(t\\)-tests for the values of the parameters. Notably, if the null hypothesis is \\(H_0: \\beta_j = c\\), then \\[\\frac{\\widehat{\\beta}_j - c}{SE(\\widehat{\\beta}_j)} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0, 1) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{\\widehat{\\beta}_j - c}{\\widehat{SE}(\\widehat{\\beta}_j)} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} t_{n-2}.\\]\nThese results are powerful as they permit the entirety of our study on \\(t\\)-tests and \\(Z\\)-tests, as well as on the relevant confidence intervals, to apply directly to the regression parameters. Conceptually, it is no different to find the confidence interval for the slope (or intercept) in a regression, as it is to find the confidence interval for a sample mean. Similarly, the test procedure for the regression procedures is equivalent, once the parameters have been estimated, as it is for the sample mean. When considering hypothesis tests we will typically focus on tests of the slope parameter, rather than tests of the intercept. Moreover, it is most typical to see tests of the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\), versus the two-sided alternative. If \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\), then the conclusion that we would draw is that there is no relationship9 between the outcome and the predictor. This is typically interpreted as saying that the predictor does not have an effect on the outcome, though, we must be cautious with such language as a hypothesis test in a regression does not necessarily constitute an assessment of causality.\nIn the case of an unknown error variance10 then there are two important considerations to make. The first is that the sampling distribution is given by a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom. This differs from the case of the sample mean, where we considered a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. The second is that, in order to estimate the standard error of either estimator, we require an estimator for the variance of the error terms, \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\). In order to estimate the error variance, we turn towards considering a breakdown of the sources of errors in the regression model as a whole.",

    "section": "19.3 Sources of Variation in Simple Linear Regression",
    "text": "19.3 Sources of Variation in Simple Linear Regression\nOne way to view a regression model is as an attempt to explain the variability in the outcome variable using the predictor. Since \\(Y\\) is a random quantity, we know that there is inherent variability in \\(Y\\), say, captured through its variance. In the sample that we obtain, we have estimated this variability using the sample variance before. An alternative method of representing the variability in the sample is to use the total variation, \\[\\text{SST} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\overline{y})^2.\\] This is the same as the sample variance, except we are not scaling amount of variability by \\(n-1\\). We refer to this as the sum of squares total or the total sum of squares, and it represents the total variability in the outcome within our sample.\n\nDefinition 19.8 (Sum of Squares Total (SST)) The total sum of squares is the sum of all squared differences between the observations of the outcome, and the overall mean of the outcome, within a sample. It measures the complete variability within a sample, and is calculated as \\[\\text{SST} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\overline{y})^2.\\]\n\nThe goal with the regression model is then to explain as much variability in the outcome as is possible, using the explanatory factor. Assuming that the linear regression model is the correct expression of the conditional mean then this will explain some portion of the differences between various observations of \\(Y\\). That is, if we take two observations in our data, \\((x_i, y_i)\\) and \\((x_j, y_j)\\), then we expect that \\(y_i \\neq y_j\\). In part this occurs if \\(x_i \\neq x_j\\), since \\(E[Y|X=x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x\\), and so there is an expected difference of \\(\\beta_1(x_i - x_j)\\). These differences can be explained by the regression model. Beyond these differences, however, there is likely to be further differences between the observations. These come from the errors in the model.\nConsider, \\(y_i - y_j\\), if we do not take expectations, this will give \\(\\beta_1(x_i - x_j) + (\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j)\\). Thus, even if \\(x_i = x_j\\), we will likely not observe \\(y_i = y_j\\) because of the error terms. The variability owing to the errors cannot be explained by the model, since the errors are purely random and not dependent on the explanatory factors. Recall that we defined the residuals to be \\(e_i = y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\). Notice that, if \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0 = \\beta_0\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1 = \\beta_1\\), we have that \\(e_i = \\epsilon_i\\). In a sense then, the residuals can then be seen as estimates of the errors. As a result, if we take the sum of squared residuals, this gives an estimate of the total variation from the errors, resulting in \\[\\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2.\\] This is referred to as either the residual sum of squares, or the error sum of squares, or sometimes the sum of squared errors.\n\nDefinition 19.9 (Residual Sum of Squares (Sum of Squared Errors; SSE)) The residual sum of squares is a measure of the amount of variability in the outcomes of a linear regression model that is not explained by the model itself. That is, it is the residual variability, after accounting for the explanatory factors. The residual sum of squares of computed as \\[\\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2.\\]\n\nIf the total sum of squares, \\(\\text{SST}\\), gives the complete variability in the outcome, and the residual sum of squares, \\(\\text{SSE}\\), gives the variability in the outcome that is left unexplained by teh model, then the difference between these two quantities gives the amount of variability that is explained by the model. That is, \\(\\text{SSR} = \\text{SST} - \\text{SSE}\\), where \\(\\text{SSR}\\) refers to the regression sum of squares. The regression sum of squares gives a measure of the explainable component of the variability in the outcome.\n\nDefinition 19.10 (Regression Sum of Squares (SSR)) The regression sum of squares is the amount of variability in the outcome that can be explained by the regression model. This captures how much variability is described by the explanatory factors. The total variability is made up of the regression sum of squares and the residual sum of squares, so that \\(\\text{SST} = \\text{SSE} + \\text{SSR}\\), and this relationship can be used to write \\[\\text{SSR} = \\text{SST} - \\text{SSE}.\\]\n\nWith the framing of regression as breaking down the source of variation, we are able to both estimate variance components that are of interest for inferential purposes, as well as diagnose how well the model seems to fit or explain the our observations. In order to conduct statistical inference in the event of an unknown error variance, we required an estimator for the variance of the error terms, denoted \\(\\sigma^2\\). Noting that the residual sum of squares approximates the total variability within the error terms, we can scale this to give an estimate of the error variance. Namely, we take \\[\\widehat{\\sigma}^2 = \\text{MSE} = \\frac{SSE}{n - 2}.\\] Here, \\(\\text{MSE}\\) refers to the mean squared errors.\n\nDefinition 19.11 (Mean Squared Error (MSE)) The mean squared error refers to an estimate of the residuals of the error terms. This estimate is derived as a scaled version of the sum of squared errors, where the \\(\\text{SSE}\\) is scaled by the total sample size less the number of estimated parameters in the model. In the case of a simple linear regression model there are \\(2\\) estimated parameters and so \\[\\text{MSE} = \\frac{\\text{SSE}}{n-2}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sampling Distribution for Simple Linear Regression Estimators (Estimated Variance)\n\n\n\nAssuming the linear model for a simple linear regression holds, and that the error variances are homogenous with a variance of \\(\\sigma^2\\) that is unknown, then so long as the sample size (\\(n\\)) is large, or that the errors can be assumed to be normally distributed, both the estimators for the intercept and slope parameters can be scaled by the mean squared error to result in a \\(t\\) distribution. Specifically, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\widehat{\\beta}_0 - \\beta_0}{\\sqrt{\\text{MSE}\\left.\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\right/\\left(n\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2\\right)}} &\\sim t_{n-2}; \\ \\text{and}\\\\\n\\frac{\\widehat{\\beta}_1 - \\beta_1}{\\sqrt{\\text{MSE}\\left/\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2\\right.}} &\\sim t_{n-2}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nThe breakdown of sources of variance can also provide a method of understanding the overall quality of the regression model. One common technique for doing this is through the use of the coefficient of determination or the \\(R^2\\) value. The coefficient of determination gives a measure of the proportion of variation that is explained by the regression model, with the idea that generally speaking, it is preferable when a model explains more variation than less.\n\nDefinition 19.12 (Coefficient of Determination (\\(R^2\\))) The coefficient of determination is a measure of the proportion of the variation in the outcome that is attributed to the regression sum of squares. This measure is typically denoted \\(R^2\\), such that \\[R^2 = \\frac{\\text{SSR}}{\\text{SST}}.\\] Note that \\(0 \\leq R^2 \\leq 1\\), and as \\(R^2\\) nears \\(1\\), the model explains more of the variability in the outcomes.\n\nThe \\(R^2\\) is an incredibly popular measure to be reported alongside the results of a linear regression model. The prominence makes it important to understand. With that said, the \\(R^2\\) is often misused or misinterpreted, and as a result, great care should be taken when encountering the \\(R^2\\) values. What follows are some frequent misinterpretations or mistakes regarding the \\(R^2\\) value, and an attempt to illustrate why these are mistake.11\n\n\\(R^2\\) is often used a measure of goodness of fit. It is not. Note that goodness of fit refers to a measure of how well the model tracks with reality. We know that in practice the mean of \\(Y\\) given \\(X=x\\) is unlikely to be precisely \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x\\), however, we hope that it is close. Measures of goodness of fit tell us whether the model appears to fit or not. Many individuals use \\(R^2\\) as a measure of the goodness of fit, however, this is inappropriate. The \\(R^2\\) value can be made to be arbitrarily small for a model that is exactly correct, for instance, by increasing the variability of the error terms. On the flip side, there is no upper bound on how high the \\(R^2\\) value can be when the model is entirely wrong – it can be arbitrarily close to \\(1\\).\nThe \\(R^2\\) is often used to compare across different datasets. It cannot be. The \\(R^2\\) is a data-dependent measure. If you take two different sources of data and compare regression models fit on each of them, the \\(R^2\\) values are entirely incomparable. If you are comparing two different models fit to the same data, then in this case, \\(R^2\\) can be compared, however, any conclusions could also be derived at by comparing (say) the \\(\\text{MSE}\\) (a more useful measure).\nThe \\(R^2\\) value is often thought to describe causality. It does not. The phrasing “the fraction of variance explained” is a misleading phrase at best. When this language is used, it is meant to say that the \\(R^2\\) gives the proportion of the total variation that is made up by the variation in the regression model. This is not to say that a high \\(R^2\\) means that the explanatory factor is a good explanatory factor of the outcome, nor to say that there is some causal connection between these components. In fact, if we fit two regression models, one where \\(Y\\) is treated as the outcome and \\(X\\) as the explanatory factor, and then a second where the roles are reversed (\\(X\\) is treated as the outcome and \\(Y\\) the explanatory variable), the \\(R^2\\) in each of these models will be exactly equivalent. As such, \\(R^2\\) can certainly not capture any “explanation” in a scientific sense of the word.\n\nThe \\(R^2\\) will not typically be a particularly useful quantity to report. However, its prominence is not likely to be minimized at any point in the near future. Correspondingly, it is important to understand what \\(R^2\\) is, and also critically, what it is not.",

    "section": "19.4 Prediction using Linear Regression",
    "text": "19.4 Prediction using Linear Regression\nTo define the residuals, we introduced \\(\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1x\\). This was thought of as the estimated expected value of \\(Y\\) given \\(X = x\\). Expressed in this way, this is an estimation procedure like any other that we have seen. That is, we are estimating the parameter of a population distribution12 using observed data. However, the notation is suggestive of an alternative perspective. Notably, suppose that beyond our sample we make a new observation with \\(X=x\\), but we do not observe the corresponding value of \\(Y\\). In this case, we can use the same relationship, \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1x\\) to make a guess as to the unobserved value for the outcome. Notice that this framing of the estimation problem is distinct from estimation problems we have previously seen. In this case, we are attempting to use data to guess the value of a variable outside of the data that we have collected. When we use estimation in this context, we no longer refer to it as estimation but instead as prediction.\n\nDefinition 19.13 (Prediction) In statistics, prediction refers to the process of using data to guess the value of a random quantity that was not observed in the sample. The specific values are typically informed through observed data. The numeric values themselves are referred to as predictions, while the functions that generate the predictions can be referred to as predictors.13\n\nOne of the most useful features of linear regression is the ability to generate predictions from the estimated regression function. The process of prediction is a very important application of statistics. Critically, with prediction, we are able to make guesses beyond the samples that we have actually recorded. This allows data in the present to inform our understanding of the future, helping to make decisions or guide action. With prediction we must be cautious, however, as we are relying on the past to be a good representation of the future. If the patterns from the past fail to hold moving forward then prediction will be invalid. Moreover, if the value of the dependent variable is far from values that were actually seen in the data, there is no way to assess the quality of prediction. These types of predictions are known as extrapolations.\n\nDefinition 19.14 (Extrapolation) When prediction occurs beyond the scope of the model, this is known as extrapolation. Specifically, extrapolation refers to predictions that are made for values of the explanatory factors that were not observed, or which are far from values that were observed, in the initial data used to fit the model. Extrapolation is typically ill-advised, as its use cannot be supported via statistical theory.\n\nThe concern with extrapolation is that there is no way to determine whether the pattern over the observed range of the explanatory factors will continue beyond the current range. It is possible that what appears to be a linear relationship over the observed data ends up looking nonlinear over a wider range. Alternatively, perhaps there is a value of the explanatory variable after which a fundamentally new pattern emerges. Extrapolation relies on the thought that the observed trends will continue indefinitely, and this assumption tends to be fairly strong. In order to responsibly extrapolate beyond the scope of a model, the extrapolation should be supported by the subject-matter theory. If there are good theoretical reasons to believe that the same pattern will continue, or that the relationship will remain linear over the entire range of the explanatory factors, then extrapolation is better supported. Critically, however, these arguments do not come from statistical observation and instead rely on subject-matter knowledge.\nAs long as the use of prediction is supported, then we can view the regression function as providing the best guess as to the value of new, unobserved data. There is uncertainty in the predictions that we make. Just as with estimation, we should never expect the predicted values to exactly equal the unobserved values. Instead, we hope that we are close to the truth. With estimation, when faced with the reality of never exactly getting the value correct, we supplemented point estimation with interval estimation. The same general concept applies for prediction. We can find prediction intervals that give a range of values that are, in some sense, equally well-supported by the observed data.\n\nDefinition 19.15 (Prediction Interval) A prediction interval is an interval estimator calibrated to contain the value of an unobserved response, based on observed explanatory factors, with a set probability. The prediction interval supports the use of (point) prediction, giving a range of plausible values for the unobserved response.\n\nTo form the prediction interval for simple linear regression, we need to consider the variability of the prediction itself. Namely, if we take \\[\\widehat{Y} = \\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1X,\\] for a set value of \\(X\\), then notice that the variance of this quantity is given by \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\text{var}\\left[\\widehat{\\beta}_0 + X\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\right] &= \\text{var}(\\widehat{\\beta}_0) + X^2\\text{var}(\\widehat{\\beta}_1)) + 2X\\text{cov}(\\widehat{\\beta}_0, \\widehat{\\beta}_1) \\\\\n    &= \\frac{\\sigma^2\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2}{n\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \\overline{X})^2} + \\frac{X^2\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \\overline{X})^2} - \\frac{2\\sigma^2X\\overline{X}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \\overline{X})^2} \\\\\n    &= \\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(X - \\overline{X})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\\] If we wished to form confidence intervals around the estimated conditional mean of \\(Y\\) given \\(X=x\\), we could use the square root of this quantity as the variance, either using the true variance when known14 or else using the MSE as an estimate of the variance15. For the prediction interval, however, we are not looking to quantify the mean directly, but rather the actual observed outcome. Recall that \\(Y = E[Y|X=x] + \\epsilon\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is an error term, with variance given by \\(\\sigma^2\\). As a result, the actual outcome should fall near \\(E[Y|X=x]\\), but will be perturbed by a noise term, \\(\\epsilon\\), with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Thus, to capture the variance of the predicted outcome, we ought to add an extra \\(\\sigma^2\\) to the variability, \\[\\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(X - \\overline{X})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2}\\right) = \\sigma^2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(X - \\overline{X})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2}\\right).\\]\nThe relevant sampling distribution will still be normal, supposing that \\(\\sigma^2\\) is known, or else a \\(t_{n-2}\\) if the MSE is used as an estimate for \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrediction Interval for an Estimated Outcome\n\n\n\nWhen estimating the value of an outcome, \\(y\\), based on an observed predictor, \\(x\\), the \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) prediction interval, taking \\(\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1x\\), is given by \\[\\widehat{y} \\pm t_{n-2, \\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\text{MSE}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x - \\overline{X})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2}\\right)}.\\]",

    "section": "19.5 Beyond Simple Linear Regression",
    "text": "19.5 Beyond Simple Linear Regression\nSimple linear regression is characterized by the use of a single predictor to explain the outcome. The framework of linear regression, however, is far more broad. The most natural extension to simple linear regression is that of multiple linear regression, where in place of a single predictor, multiple predictors are used. In this setting the relationship between the outcome and the predictors remains linear, however, each predictor has its own slope coefficient. For instance, we may write \\[E[Y|X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, X_3=x_3] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\beta_3x_3,\\] and so forth. The same estimation procedure16 can apply to give estimates of the various parameters, and the same types of distributional results apply for inference, giving both confidence and prediction intervals. Statistical software will readily estimate regression lines with large numbers of predictors, and by including increasing numbers of explanatory factors, the model fit will correspondingly improve. The main difficulty with multiple regression, compared to simple linear regression, is that the parameters need to be interpreted with more care: by considering multiple factors at the same time, our interpretations also need to do so.\nOther extensions to the framework of regression modeling exist as well. For instance, there are generalized linear models, that can take outcome variables that are not continuous, and fit them using linear functions. This is particularly useful if the outcome is, for instance, a binary indicator17 or count data.18 These generalized linear models require an expansion of the theory, but are based on many of the same underlying principles. Regression models can also move beyond linear functions of the predictors. There are nonlinear forms of regression that capture more complex relationships, whether the outcome is continuous or otherwise.\nFundamentally, regression modelling specifies a model for the conditional mean of an outcome, given some number of predictors. This is a very general problem, and there has correspondingly been a tremendous amount of development of techniques for addressing this concern. Many procedures in statistics, and questions in science more broadly, can be formulated through a regression framework. For this reason, regression remains an incredibly powerful tool to make use of, for both inference and prediction. Simple linear regression is useful in certain contexts, however, it can also be viewed as an approachable first-step towards understanding the broader world of regression modelling.",

    "section": "19.6 Linear Regression in R",
    "text": "19.6 Linear Regression in R\nFortunately, R makes the computation of a linear regression – along with the testing of hypotheses surrounding the regression, straightforward to complete. The primary function of interest is the lm function, standing for a linear model. The lm function can take in many different parameters, however, the primary argument that is required is the model formula. In R, a formula is a special arrangement of variables which define a particular mathematical relationship. For instance, we may write lm(y ~ x). Here, y ~ x is the formula.\nTo read this formula we consider the left-hand side (to the left of ~) and the right-hand side (to the right of ~) separately. The left-hand side specifies the dependent variable, or the outcome. In this case, we are saying that the variable y contains the dependent observations. On the right-hand side, we include any explanatory factors of interest, so in this case, there is a single predictor, x. If R is to be used beyond simple linear regression, we may write, for instance, lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3), to fit a model where y is explained by x1, x2, and x3. Note that, by default, a formula in R will include an intercept. That is, we do not need to include an explicit term specifying to fit \\(\\beta_0\\), as R will do this by default.\nThe variables passed into the formula can be variables that exist in the environment broadly, or, they can be columns of a dataframe. If we have defined a dataframe with a column, my_df$outcome and another, my_df$predictor then the linear model can be fit using the call lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = my_df). Here, the variables in the formula will be drawn from the dataframe passed in as the data argument, but otherwise they are read the same way. This is particularly useful as it enables us to collect and store data in one location, and then fit the regression model directly to these data.\nOnce a regression model has been fit, the object itself contains a great deal of information. Most of this can be read via the summary function. This will output a thorough summary of the regression, including the coefficients, their standard errors, \\(t\\)-tests of the hypotheses that they are actually equal to \\(0\\), as well as the mean squared error, degrees of freedom, and \\(R^2\\) value (among other reported quantities). When it is only the estimated coefficients that are of interest, coef will return a named vector of the parameters in the model. Beyond summary, the predict function can be useful. The predict function takes in the fitted linear model, as well as the newdata and interval arguments. The newdata is a dataframe that has a column for each of the predictor variables used in the model (the outcome is not required). It will then use the fitted model to predict the outcome (or expected conditional mean) based on the input. The interval parameter is optional, and can be set to either \"prediction\" or \"confidence\", in order to automatically compute a prediction or confidence interval around the predicted value. By default this will be at the \\(95\\%\\) level of confidence, but this can be controlled using the level argument.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen reading the summary output, the table of Coefficients gives the estimated value (Estimate), standard error (Std. Error), \\(t\\)-test statistic (t value), and the \\(p\\)-value (Pr(&gt;|t|)). Beneath, the mean-squared error is listed as the Residual standard error, with the relevant number of degrees of freedom specified for the \\(t\\)-distribution. The \\(R^2\\) is given as Multiple R-squared beneath that. The output from the predict function is a matrix, with a column of the predicted point estimated (fit), followed by the lower and upper bounds on the interval (lwr and upr, respectively).",

Doing this results in alternative forms of the regression relationship, forms that exhibit slightly different properties. The least squares regression tends to be the most common in use, is the most well-studied, and is in many ways the most mathematically convenient.↩︎\nAs well as, more critically, the assumption that the regression model is correct and the assumption that variances are homogenous.↩︎\nRecall that the standard errors are given by the square root of the variance terms. It is convenient when the variance of estimator is a fairly involved expression (as is the case for the regression parameters), to use the shorthand notation.↩︎\nLinear relationship.↩︎\nThis case is of course far more common in practice↩︎\nNote, a more thorough, theoretical account of these issues is available here. This requires a deeper understanding of regression more broadly.↩︎\nNamely, the conditional distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(X=x\\).↩︎\nThis distinction is analogous to the estimates and estimators distinction.↩︎\nWith a normal distribution.↩︎\nWith a \\(t\\) distribution↩︎\nUsing ordinary least squares.↩︎\nPerhaps a \\(1\\) if an individual has a particular disease, and a \\(0\\) otherwise.↩︎\nMaybe the number of defective products produced in a shift by a manufacturing plant.↩︎",
